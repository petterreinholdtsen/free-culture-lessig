"Congress responded by giving broadcasters a right to compensation, but at a "

"This compromise, like the compromise affecting records and player pianos, "
"served two important goals&mdash;indeed, the two central goals of any "
"copyright legislation. First, the law assured that new innovators would have "
"the freedom to develop new ways to deliver content.  Second, the law assured "
"that copyright holders would be paid for the content that was "
"distributed. One fear was that if Congress simply required cable TV to pay "
"copyright holders whatever they demanded for their content, then copyright "
"holders associated with broadcasters would use their power to stifle this "
"new technology, cable. But if Congress had permitted cable to use "
"broadcasters' content for free, then it would have unfairly subsidized "
"cable. Thus Congress chose a path that would assure "
"<emphasis>compensation</emphasis> without giving the past (broadcasters) "

"Considered as a matter of abstract justice&mdash;reasoning as if justice "

"principles&mdash;Mansfield's conclusion might make some sense. But what it "
"ignored was the larger issue that Parliament had struggled with in 1710: How "
"best to limit the monopoly power of publishers? Parliament's strategy was to "
"offer a term for existing works that was long enough to buy peace in 1710, "
"but short enough to assure that culture would pass into competition within a "
"reasonable period of time. Within twenty-one years, Parliament believed, "
"Britain would mature from the controlled culture that the Crown coveted to "
"the free culture that we inherited."

"The idea would be a modification of a proposal that has been floated by "
"Harvard law professor William Fisher.<placeholder type=\"footnote\" "

"would (1) be marked with a digital watermark (don't worry about how easy it "
"is to evade these marks; as you'll see, there's no incentive to evade "
"them). Once the content is marked, then entrepreneurs would develop (2) "

"Fisher's proposal is careful and comprehensive. It raises a million "

"<citetitle>Promises to Keep</citetitle>. The modification that I would make "
"is relatively simple: Fisher imagines his proposal replacing the existing "
"copyright system.  I imagine it complementing the existing system. The aim "
"of the proposal would be to facilitate compensation to the extent that harm "
"could be shown. This compensation would be temporary, aimed at facilitating "
"a transition between regimes. And it would require renewal after a period of "
"years. If it continues to make sense to facilitate free exchange of content, "
"supported through a taxation system, then it can be continued. If this form "
"of protection is no longer necessary, then the system could lapse into the "
"old system of controlling access."

"<quote>America needs a national conversation about the way in which "
"so-called <quote>intellectual property rights</quote> have come to dominate "
"the rights of scholars, researchers, and everyday citizens. A copyright "
"cartel, bidding for absolute control over digital worlds, music, and movies, "
"now has a veto over technological innovation and has halted most "
"contributions to the public domain from which so many have benefited. The "
"patent system has spun out of control, giving enormous power to entrenched "
"interests, and even trademarks are being misused. Lawrence Lessig's latest "
"book is essential reading for anyone who want to join this conversation. He "
"explains how technology and the law are robbing us of the public domain; but "
"for all his educated pessimism, Professor Lessig offers some solutions, too, "
"because he recognizes that technology can be the catalyst for freedom. If "
"you care about the future of innovation, read this book.</quote> &mdash; "
