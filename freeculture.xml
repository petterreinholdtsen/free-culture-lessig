<title>Preface</title>
<indexterm id='idxpoguedavid' class='startofrange'><primary>Pogue, David</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Code (Lessig)</primary></indexterm>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">At the end</emphasis> of his review of my first
book, <citetitle>Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace</citetitle>, David
Pogue, a brilliant writer and author of countless technical and
computer-related texts, wrote this:
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
Unlike actual law, Internet software has no capacity to punish. It
doesn't affect people who aren't online (and only a tiny minority
of the world population is). And if you don't like the Internet's
system, you can always flip off the modem.<footnote id="preface01"><para>
David Pogue, <quote>Don't Just Chat, Do Something,</quote> <citetitle>New York Times</citetitle>, 30 January 2000.
</para></footnote>
</para>
</blockquote>
<para>
Pogue was skeptical of the core argument of the book&mdash;that
software, or <quote>code,</quote> functioned as a kind of law&mdash;and his review
suggested the happy thought that if life in cyberspace got bad, we
could always <quote>drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome</quote>-like simply flip a
switch and be back home. Turn off the modem, unplug the computer, and
any troubles that exist in <emphasis>that</emphasis> space wouldn't
<quote>affect</quote> us anymore.
</para>
<para>
Pogue might have been right in 1999&mdash;I'm skeptical, but maybe.
But even if he was right then, the point is not right now:
<citetitle>Free Culture</citetitle> is about the troubles the Internet
causes even after the modem is turned
<!--PAGE BREAK 12-->
off. It is an argument about how the battles that now rage regarding life
on-line have fundamentally affected <quote>people who aren't online.</quote> There
is no switch that will insulate us from the Internet's effect.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxpoguedavid' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
But unlike <citetitle>Code</citetitle>, the argument here is not much
about the Internet itself. It is instead about the consequence of the
Internet to a part of our tradition that is much more fundamental,
and, as hard as this is for a geek-wanna-be to admit, much more
important.
</para>
<para>
That tradition is the way our culture gets made. As I explain in the
pages that follow, we come from a tradition of <quote>free culture</quote>&mdash;not
<quote>free</quote> as in <quote>free beer</quote> (to borrow a phrase from the founder of the
free software movement<footnote>
<para>
Richard M. Stallman, <citetitle>Free Software, Free Societies</citetitle> 57 (Joshua Gay, ed. 2002).
</para></footnote>), but <quote>free</quote> as in <quote>free speech,</quote> <quote>free markets,</quote>
<quote>free trade,</quote> <quote>free enterprise,</quote> <quote>free will,</quote> and <quote>free elections.</quote> A
free culture supports and protects creators and innovators. It does
this directly by granting intellectual property rights. But it does so
indirectly by limiting the reach of those rights, to guarantee that
follow-on creators and innovators remain <emphasis>as free as
possible</emphasis> from the control of the past. A free culture is
not a culture without property, just as a free market is not a market
in which everything is free. The opposite of a free culture is a
<quote>permission culture</quote>&mdash;a culture in which creators get to create
only with the permission of the powerful, or of creators from the
past.
</para>
<para>
If we understood this change, I believe we would resist it. Not <quote>we</quote>
on the Left or <quote>you</quote> on the Right, but we who have no stake in the
particular industries of culture that defined the twentieth century.
Whether you are on the Left or the Right, if you are in this sense
disinterested, then the story I tell here will trouble you. For the
changes I describe affect values that both sides of our political
culture deem fundamental.

<para>
We saw a glimpse of this bipartisan outrage in the early summer of
2003. As the FCC considered changes in media ownership rules that
would relax limits on media concentration, an extraordinary coalition
generated more than 700,000 letters to the FCC opposing the change.
As William Safire described marching <quote>uncomfortably alongside CodePink
Women for Peace and the National Rifle Association, between liberal
Olympia Snowe and conservative Ted Stevens,</quote> he formulated perhaps
most simply just what was at stake: the concentration of power. And as
he asked,
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
Does that sound unconservative? Not to me. The concentration of
power&mdash;political, corporate, media, cultural&mdash;should be anathema to
conservatives. The diffusion of power through local control, thereby
encouraging individual participation, is the essence of federalism and
the greatest expression of democracy.<footnote><para> William Safire,
<quote>The Great Media Gulp,</quote> <citetitle>New York Times</citetitle>, 22 May 2003.
<indexterm><primary>Safire, William</primary></indexterm>
</para></footnote>
</para>
</blockquote>
<para>
This idea is an element of the argument of <citetitle>Free Culture</citetitle>, though my
focus is not just on the concentration of power produced by
concentrations in ownership, but more importantly, if because less
visibly, on the concentration of power produced by a radical change in
the effective scope of the law. The law is changing; that change is
altering the way our culture gets made; that change should worry
you&mdash;whether or not you care about the Internet, and whether you're on
Safire's left or on his right.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxpowerconcentrationof' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
<emphasis role="strong">The inspiration</emphasis> for the title and for
much of the argument of this book comes from the work of Richard
Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. Indeed, as I reread
Stallman's own work, especially the essays in <citetitle>Free Software, Free
Society</citetitle>, I realize that all of the theoretical insights I develop here
are insights Stallman described decades ago. One could thus well argue
that this work is <quote>merely</quote> derivative.
</para>
<para>
I accept that criticism, if indeed it is a criticism. The work of a
lawyer is always derivative, and I mean to do nothing more in this
book than to remind a culture about a tradition that has always been
its own.  Like Stallman, I defend that tradition on the basis of
values. Like Stallman, I believe those are the values of freedom. And
like Stallman, I believe those are values of our past that will need
to be defended in our future. A free culture has been our past, but it
will only be our future if we change the path we are on right now.

<!--PAGE BREAK 14-->
Like Stallman's arguments for free software, an argument for free
culture stumbles on a confusion that is hard to avoid, and even harder
to understand. A free culture is not a culture without property; it is not
a culture in which artists don't get paid. A culture without property, or
in which creators can't get paid, is anarchy, not freedom. Anarchy is not
what I advance here.
</para>
<para>
Instead, the free culture that I defend in this book is a balance
between anarchy and control. A free culture, like a free market, is
filled with property. It is filled with rules of property and contract
that get enforced by the state. But just as a free market is perverted
if its property becomes feudal, so too can a free culture be queered
by extremism in the property rights that define it. That is what I
fear about our culture today. It is against that extremism that this
book is written.

<para>
<emphasis role="strong">On December 17</emphasis>, 1903, on a windy North Carolina beach for just
shy of one hundred seconds, the Wright brothers demonstrated that a
heavier-than-air, self-propelled vehicle could fly. The moment was electric
and its importance widely understood. Almost immediately, there
was an explosion of interest in this newfound technology of manned
flight, and a gaggle of innovators began to build upon it.

<para>
At the time the Wright brothers invented the airplane, American
law held that a property owner presumptively owned not just the surface
of his land, but all the land below, down to the center of the earth,
and all the space above, to <quote>an indefinite extent, upwards.</quote><footnote><para>

Rothman Reprints, 1969), 18.
</para></footnote>
For many
years, scholars had puzzled about how best to interpret the idea that
rights in land ran to the heavens. Did that mean that you owned the
stars? Could you prosecute geese for their willful and regular trespass?
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxwrightbrothers' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
Then came airplanes, and for the first time, this principle of American
law&mdash;deep within the foundations of our tradition, and acknowledged
by the most important legal thinkers of our past&mdash;mattered. If
my land reaches to the heavens, what happens when United flies over
my field? Do I have the right to banish it from my property? Am I allowed
to enter into an exclusive license with Delta Airlines? Could we
set up an auction to decide how much these rights are worth?
</para>

<para>
In 1945, these questions became a federal case. When North Carolina
farmers Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby started losing chickens
because of low-flying military aircraft (the terrified chickens apparently
flew into the barn walls and died), the Causbys filed a lawsuit saying
that the government was trespassing on their land. The airplanes,
of course, never touched the surface of the Causbys' land. But if, as
Blackstone, Kent, and Coke had said, their land reached to <quote>an indefinite
extent, upwards,</quote> then the government was trespassing on their
property, and the Causbys wanted it to stop.

<para>
The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Causbys' case. Congress had
declared the airways public, but if one's property really extended to the
heavens, then Congress's declaration could well have been an unconstitutional
<quote>taking</quote> of property without compensation. The Court acknowledged
that <quote>it is ancient doctrine that common law ownership of
the land extended to the periphery of the universe.</quote> But Justice Douglas
had no patience for ancient doctrine. In a single paragraph, hundreds of
years of property law were erased. As he wrote for the Court,
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
[The] doctrine has no place in the modern world. The air is a
public highway, as Congress has declared. Were that not true,
every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless
trespass suits. Common sense revolts at the idea. To recognize
such private claims to the airspace would clog these highways, 
seriously interfere with their control and development in the public
interest, and transfer into private ownership that to which only
the public has a just claim.<footnote>
<para>
United States v. Causby, U.S. 328 (1946): 256, 261. The Court did find
that there could be a <quote>taking</quote> if the government's use of its land
effectively destroyed the value of the Causbys' land. This example was
suggested to me by Keith Aoki's wonderful piece, <quote>(Intellectual)
Property and Sovereignty: Notes Toward a Cultural Geography of
Authorship,</quote> <citetitle>Stanford Law Review</citetitle> 48 (1996): 1293, 1333. See also Paul

This is how the law usually works. Not often this abruptly or
impatiently, but eventually, this is how it works. It was Douglas's style not to
dither. Other justices would have blathered on for pages to reach the
<!--PAGE BREAK 18-->
conclusion that Douglas holds in a single line: <quote>Common sense revolts
at the idea.</quote> But whether it takes pages or a few words, it is the special
genius of a common law system, as ours is, that the law adjusts to the
technologies of the time. And as it adjusts, it changes. Ideas that were

Or at least, this is how things happen when there's no one powerful
on the other side of the change. The Causbys were just farmers. And
though there were no doubt many like them who were upset by the
growing traffic in the air (though one hopes not many chickens flew
themselves into walls), the Causbys of the world would find it very
hard to unite and stop the idea, and the technology, that the Wright
brothers had birthed. The Wright brothers spat airplanes into the
technological meme pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken
coop; farmers like the Causbys found themselves surrounded by <quote>what
seemed reasonable</quote> given the technology that the Wrights had produced.
They could stand on their farms, dead chickens in hand, and
shake their fists at these newfangled technologies all they wanted.
They could call their representatives or even file a lawsuit. But in the
end, the force of what seems <quote>obvious</quote> to everyone else&mdash;the power of
<quote>common sense</quote>&mdash;would prevail. Their <quote>private interest</quote> would not be
allowed to defeat an obvious public gain.

<emphasis role='strong'>Edwin Howard Armstrong</emphasis> is one of
America's forgotten inventor geniuses. He came to the great American
inventor scene just after the titans Thomas Edison and Alexander
Graham Bell. But his work in the area of radio technology was perhaps
the most important of any single inventor in the first fifty years of
radio. He was better educated than Michael Faraday, who as a
bookbinder's apprentice had discovered electric induction in 1831. But
he had the same intuition about how the world of radio worked, and on
at least three occasions, Armstrong invented profoundly important
technologies that advanced our understanding of radio.
<!-- PAGE BREAK 19 -->
</para>
<para>
On the day after Christmas, 1933, four patents were issued to Armstrong
for his most significant invention&mdash;FM radio. Until then, consumer radio
had been amplitude-modulated (AM) radio. The theorists
of the day had said that frequency-modulated (FM) radio could never
work. They were right about FM radio in a narrow band of spectrum.
But Armstrong discovered that frequency-modulated radio in a wide
band of spectrum would deliver an astonishing fidelity of sound, with
much less transmitter power and static.
</para>
<para>
On November 5, 1935, he demonstrated the technology at a meeting of
the Institute of Radio Engineers at the Empire State Building in New
York City. He tuned his radio dial across a range of AM stations,
until the radio locked on a broadcast that he had arranged from
seventeen miles away. The radio fell totally silent, as if dead, and
then with a clarity no one else in that room had ever heard from an
electrical device, it produced the sound of an announcer's voice:
<quote>This is amateur station W2AG at Yonkers, New York, operating on
frequency modulation at two and a half meters.</quote>

The audience was hearing something no one had thought possible:

superior radio technology. But at the time of his invention, Armstrong
was working for RCA. RCA was the dominant player in the then dominant
AM radio market. By 1935, there were a thousand radio stations across
the United States, but the stations in large cities were all owned by
a handful of networks.

RCA at first kept the technology in house, insisting that further
tests were needed. When, after two years of testing, Armstrong grew
impatient, RCA began to use its power with the government to stall
FM radio's deployment generally. In 1936, RCA hired the former head
of the FCC and assigned him the task of assuring that the FCC assign
spectrum in a way that would castrate FM&mdash;principally by moving FM
radio to a different band of spectrum. At first, these efforts failed. But
when Armstrong and the nation were distracted by World War II,
RCA's work began to be more successful. Soon after the war ended, the
FCC announced a set of policies that would have one clear effect: FM
radio would be crippled. As Lawrence Lessing described it,

To make room in the spectrum for RCA's latest gamble, television,
FM radio users were to be moved to a totally new spectrum band. The
power of FM radio stations was also cut, meaning FM could no longer
be used to beam programs from one part of the country to another.
(This change was strongly supported by AT&amp;T, because the loss of
FM relaying stations would mean radio stations would have to buy
wired links from AT&amp;T.) The spread of FM radio was thus choked, at
least temporarily.

Armstrong resisted RCA's efforts. In response, RCA resisted
Armstrong's patents. After incorporating FM technology into the
emerging standard for television, RCA declared the patents
invalid&mdash;baselessly, and almost fifteen years after they were
issued. It thus refused to pay him royalties. For six years, Armstrong
fought an expensive war of litigation to defend the patents. Finally,
just as the patents expired, RCA offered a settlement so low that it
would not even cover Armstrong's lawyers' fees. Defeated, broken, and
now broke, in 1954 Armstrong wrote a short note to his wife and then
stepped out of a thirteenth-story window to his death.

This is how the law sometimes works. Not often this tragically, and
rarely with heroic drama, but sometimes, this is how it works. From
the beginning, government and government agencies have been subject to
capture. They are more likely captured when a powerful interest is
threatened by either a legal or technical change. That powerful
interest too often exerts its influence within the government to get
the government to protect it. The rhetoric of this protection is of
course always public spirited; the reality is something
different. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age, but that, left

As the Internet has been integrated into ordinary life, it has
changed things. Some of these changes are technical&mdash;the Internet has
made communication faster, it has lowered the cost of gathering data,
and so on. These technical changes are not the focus of this book. They
are important. They are not well understood. But they are the sort of
thing that would simply go away if we all just switched the Internet off.
They don't affect people who don't use the Internet, or at least they
don't affect them directly. They are the proper subject of a book about
the Internet. But this is not a book about the Internet.
</para>
<para>
Instead, this book is about an effect of the Internet beyond the
Internet itself: an effect upon how culture is made. My claim is that
the Internet has induced an important and unrecognized change in that
process. That change will radically transform a tradition that is as
old as the Republic itself. Most, if they recognized this change,
would reject it. Yet most don't even see the change that the Internet
has introduced.

We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between
commercial and noncommercial culture, and by mapping the law's

culture that is produced and sold or produced to be sold. By
<quote>noncommercial culture</quote> I mean all the rest. When old men sat around

noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his <quote>Reader,</quote> or
Joel Barlow his poetry, that was commercial culture.
</para>
<para>
At the beginning of our history, and for just about the whole of our
tradition, noncommercial culture was essentially unregulated. Of
course, if your stories were lewd, or if your song disturbed the
peace, then the law might intervene. But the law was never directly
concerned with the creation or spread of this form of culture, and it
left this culture <quote>free.</quote> The ordinary ways in which ordinary
individuals shared and transformed their culture&mdash;telling
stories, reenacting scenes from plays or TV, participating in fan

The focus of the law was on commercial creativity. At first slightly,
then quite extensively, the law protected the incentives of creators by
granting them exclusive rights to their creative work, so that they could
sell those exclusive rights in a commercial
marketplace.<footnote>

This is not the only purpose of copyright, though it is the overwhelmingly
primary purpose of the copyright established in the federal constitution.
State copyright law historically protected not just the commercial interest in
publication, but also a privacy interest. By granting authors the exclusive
right to first publication, state copyright law gave authors the power to
control the spread of facts about them. See Samuel D. Warren and Louis

This is also, of course, an important part of creativity and culture,

The Internet has set the stage for this erasure and, pushed by big
media, the law has now affected it. For the first time in our
tradition, the ordinary ways in which individuals create and share
culture fall within the reach of the regulation of the law, which has
expanded to draw within its control a vast amount of culture and
creativity that it never reached before. The technology that preserved
the balance of our history&mdash;between uses of our culture that were
free and uses of our culture that were only upon permission&mdash;has
been undone.  The consequence is that we are less and less a free
culture, more and more a permission culture.

This change gets justified as necessary to protect commercial

motivation. But the protectionism that justifies the changes that I
will describe below is not the limited and balanced sort that has
defined the law in the past. This is not a protectionism to protect
artists. It is instead a protectionism to protect certain forms of
business. Corporations threatened by the potential of the Internet to
change the way both commercial and noncommercial culture are made and
shared have united to induce lawmakers to use the law to protect
them. It is the story of RCA and Armstrong; it is the dream of the

For the Internet has unleashed an extraordinary possibility for many
to participate in the process of building and cultivating a culture
that reaches far beyond local boundaries. That power has changed the
marketplace for making and cultivating culture generally, and that
change in turn threatens established content industries. The Internet
is thus to the industries that built and distributed content in the
twentieth century what FM radio was to AM radio, or what the truck was
to the railroad industry of the nineteenth century: the beginning of
the end, or at least a substantial transformation. Digital
technologies, tied to the Internet, could produce a vastly more
competitive and vibrant market for building and cultivating culture;
that market could include a much wider and more diverse range of
creators; those creators could produce and distribute a much more
vibrant range of creativity; and depending upon a few important
factors, those creators could earn more on average from this system
than creators do today&mdash;all so long as the RCAs of our day don't
use the law to protect themselves against this competition.
</para>
<para>
Yet, as I argue in the pages that follow, that is precisely what is
happening in our culture today. These modern-day equivalents of the
early twentieth-century radio or nineteenth-century railroads are
using their power to get the law to protect them against this new,
more efficient, more vibrant technology for building culture. They are
succeeding in their plan to remake the Internet before the Internet
remakes them.

mainly about a much simpler brace of questions&mdash;whether <quote>piracy</quote> will
be permitted, and whether <quote>property</quote> will be protected. The <quote>war</quote> that

rule of law and respect for property. To know which side to take in this

But those simple beliefs mask a much more fundamental question
and a much more dramatic change. My fear is that unless we come to see
this change, the war to rid the world of Internet <quote>pirates</quote> will also rid our
culture of values that have been integral to our tradition from the start.

These values built a tradition that, for at least the first 180 years of

And as Professor Neil Netanel powerfully argues,<footnote>

copyright law, properly balanced, protected creators against private
control. Our tradition was thus neither Soviet nor the tradition of
patrons. It instead carved out a wide berth within which creators
could cultivate and extend our culture.
</para>
<para>
Yet the law's response to the Internet, when tied to changes in the
technology of the Internet itself, has massively increased the
effective regulation of creativity in America. To build upon or
critique the culture around us one must ask, Oliver Twist&ndash;like,
for permission first.  Permission is, of course, often
granted&mdash;but it is not often granted to the critical or the
independent. We have built a kind of cultural nobility; those within
the noble class live easily; those outside it don't. But it is
nobility of any form that is alien to our tradition.

It is instead an effort to understand a hopelessly destructive war

Instead, in our tradition, intellectual property is an instrument. It
sets the groundwork for a richly creative society but remains
subservient to the value of creativity. The current debate has this
turned around. We have become so concerned with protecting the
instrument that we are losing sight of the value.

<para>
The source of this confusion is a distinction that the law no longer
takes care to draw&mdash;the distinction between republishing someone's
work on the one hand and building upon or transforming that work on
the other. Copyright law at its birth had only publishing as its concern;
copyright law today regulates both.

Before the technologies of the Internet, this conflation didn't matter
all that much. The technologies of publishing were expensive; that
meant the vast majority of publishing was commercial. Commercial
entities could bear the burden of the law&mdash;even the burden of the
Byzantine complexity that copyright law has become. It was just one
more expense of doing business.

But with the birth of the Internet, this natural limit to the reach of
the law has disappeared. The law controls not just the creativity of
commercial creators but effectively that of anyone. Although that
expansion would not matter much if copyright law regulated only
<quote>copying,</quote> when the law regulates as broadly and obscurely as it does,
the extension matters a lot. The burden of this law now vastly
outweighs any original benefit&mdash;certainly as it affects
noncommercial creativity, and increasingly as it affects commercial
creativity as well. Thus, as we'll see more clearly in the chapters
below, the law's role is less and less to support creativity, and more
and more to protect certain industries against competition. Just at
the time digital technology could unleash an extraordinary range of
commercial and noncommercial creativity, the law burdens this
creativity with insanely complex and vague rules and with the threat
of obscenely severe penalties. We may

In <citetitle>The Rise of the Creative Class</citetitle> (New York:
Basic Books, 2002), Richard Florida documents a shift in the nature of
labor toward a labor of creativity.  His work, however, doesn't
directly address the legal conditions under which that creativity is
enabled or stifled. I certainly agree with him about the importance
and significance of this change, but I also believe the conditions
under which it will be enabled are much more tenuous.

technique and mix sound with cartoons. No one knew whether it would
work or, if it did work, whether it would win an audience. But when
Disney ran a test in the summer of 1928, the results were unambiguous.
As Disney describes that first experiment,

Disney's invention that set the standard that others struggled to

So did many others. Early cartoons are filled with
knockoffs&mdash;slight variations on winning themes; retellings of
ancient stories. The key to success was the brilliance of the
differences. With Disney, it was sound that gave his animation its
spark. Later, it was the quality of his work relative to the
production-line cartoons with which he competed. Yet these additions
were built upon a base that was borrowed.  Disney added to the work of
others before him, creating something new out of something just barely
old.
</para>
<indexterm id='idxgrimmfairytales' class='startofrange'><primary>Grimm fairy tales</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Sometimes this borrowing was slight. Sometimes it was significant.
Think about the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. If you're as
oblivious as I was, you're likely to think that these tales are happy,
sweet stories, appropriate for any child at bedtime. In fact, the
Grimm fairy tales are, well, for us, grim. It is a rare and perhaps
overly ambitious parent who would dare to read these bloody,
moralistic stories to his or her child, at bedtime or anytime.
</para>
<para>
Disney took these stories and retold them in a way that carried them
into a new age. He animated the stories, with both characters and
light. Without removing the elements of fear and danger altogether, he
made funny what was dark and injected a genuine emotion of compassion
where before there was fear. And not just with the work of the
Brothers Grimm. Indeed, the catalog of Disney work drawing upon the
work of others is astonishing when set together: <citetitle>Snow White</citetitle>
(1937), <citetitle>Fantasia</citetitle> (1940), <citetitle>Pinocchio</citetitle> (1940), <citetitle>Dumbo</citetitle>

<citetitle>The Jungle Book</citetitle> (1967)&mdash;not to mention a recent example
that we should perhaps quickly forget, <citetitle>Treasure Planet</citetitle>
(2003). In all of these cases, Disney (or Disney, Inc.) ripped
creativity from the culture around him, mixed that creativity with his
own extraordinary talent, and then burned that mix into the soul of
his culture. Rip, mix, and burn.

<para> In 1928, the culture that Disney was free to draw upon was
relatively fresh. The public domain in 1928 was not very old and was
therefore quite vibrant. The average term of copyright was just around
thirty years&mdash;for that minority of creative work that was in fact
copyrighted.<footnote><para>
<!-- f4 -->
Until 1976, copyright law granted an author the possibility of two terms: an
initial term and a renewal term. I have calculated the <quote>average</quote> term by 
determining
the weighted average of total registrations for any particular year,
and the proportion renewing. Thus, if 100 copyrights are registered in year
1, and only 15 are renewed, and the renewal term is 28 years, then the 
average
term is 32.2 years. For the renewal data and other relevant data, see the
Web site associated with this book, available at 
<ulink url="http://free-culture.cc/notes/">link #6</ulink>.
</para></footnote>
That means that for thirty years, on average, the authors or
copyright holders of a creative work had an <quote>exclusive right</quote> to control
certain uses of the work. To use this copyrighted work in limited ways
required the permission of the copyright owner.
</para>
<para>
At the end of a copyright term, a work passes into the public domain.
No permission is then needed to draw upon or use that work. No
permission and, hence, no lawyers. The public domain is a <quote>lawyer-free
zone.</quote> Thus, most of the content from the nineteenth century was free
for Disney to use and build upon in 1928. It was free for
anyone&mdash; whether connected or not, whether rich or not, whether
approved or not&mdash;to use and build upon.
</para>

<indexterm startref='idxfilmsanimated' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
This is the ways things always were&mdash;until quite recently. For most
of our history, the public domain was just over the horizon. From
until 1978, the average copyright term was never more than thirty-two
years, meaning that most culture just a generation and a half old was

<!-- PAGE BREAK 38 -->
free for anyone to build upon without the permission of anyone else.
Today's equivalent would be for creative work from the 1960s and 1970s
to now be free for the next Walt Disney to build upon without
permission. Yet today, the public domain is presumptive only for
content from before the Great Depression.

Consider, for example, a form of creativity that seems strange to many
Americans but that is inescapable within Japanese culture: <citetitle>manga</citetitle>, or
comics. The Japanese are fanatics about comics. Some 40 percent of

from comics. They are everywhere in Japanese society, at every
magazine stand, carried by a large proportion of commuters on Japan's
extraordinary system of public transportation.

cover every aspect of social life. For us, comics are <quote>men in tights.</quote>

This is the phenomenon of <citetitle>doujinshi</citetitle>. Doujinshi are also comics, but
they are a kind of copycat comic. A rich ethic governs the creation of
doujinshi. It is not doujinshi if it is <emphasis>just</emphasis> a
copy; the artist must make a contribution to the art he copies, by
transforming it either subtly or
<!-- PAGE BREAK 39 -->
significantly. A doujinshi comic can thus take a mainstream comic and
develop it differently&mdash;with a different story line. Or the comic can
keep the character in character but change its look slightly. There is no
formula for what makes the doujinshi sufficiently <quote>different.</quote> But they
must be different if they are to be considered true doujinshi. Indeed,
there are committees that review doujinshi for inclusion within shows

These copycat comics are not a tiny part of the manga market. They are

these bits of Walt Disney creativity. More than 450,000 Japanese come
together twice a year, in the largest public gathering in the country,
to exchange and sell them. This market exists in parallel to the
mainstream commercial manga market. In some ways, it obviously
competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort by those
who control the commercial manga market to shut the doujinshi market
down. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law.

The most puzzling feature of the doujinshi market, for those trained

Japanese copyright law, which in this respect (on paper) mirrors
American copyright law, the doujinshi market is an illegal
one. Doujinshi are plainly <quote>derivative works.</quote> There is no general
practice by doujinshi artists of securing the permission of the manga
creators. Instead, the practice is simply to take and modify the
creations of others, as Walt Disney did with <citetitle>Steamboat Bill,

The norm in Japan mitigates this legal difficulty. Some say it is
precisely the benefit accruing to the Japanese manga market that
explains the mitigation. Temple University law professor Salil Mehra,
for example, hypothesizes that the manga market accepts these
technical violations because they spur the manga market to be more
wealthy and productive. Everyone would be worse off if doujinshi were
banned, so the law does not ban doujinshi.<footnote><para>

rationality that would lead manga and anime artists to forgo bringing

The problem with this story, however, as Mehra plainly acknowledges,
is that the mechanism producing this laissez faire response is not
clear. It may well be that the market as a whole is better off if
doujinshi are permitted rather than banned, but that doesn't explain
why individual copyright owners don't sue nonetheless. If the law has
no general exception for doujinshi, and indeed in some cases
individual manga artists have sued doujinshi artists, why is there not
a more general pattern of blocking this <quote>free taking</quote> by the doujinshi
culture?

This is a theme to which we will return: that regulation by law is a

begged: Would Japan be better off with more lawyers? Would manga

Japanese gain something important if they could end this practice of

Eastman, himself an amateur photographer, was frustrated by the
technology of photographs made with plates. In a flash of insight (so
to speak), Eastman saw that if the film could be made to be flexible,
it could be held on a single spindle. That roll could then be sent to
a developer, driving the costs of photography down substantially. By
lowering the costs, Eastman expected he could dramatically broaden the

For $25, anyone could make pictures. The camera came preloaded
with film, and when it had been used, the camera was returned to an
Eastman factory, where the film was developed. Over time, of course,
the cost of the camera and the ease with which it could be used both
improved. Roll film thus became the basis for the explosive growth of
popular photography. Eastman's camera first went on sale in 1888; one
year later, Kodak was printing more than six thousand negatives a day.
From 1888 through 1909, while industrial production was rising by 4.7

The real significance of Eastman's invention, however, was not
economic. It was social. Professional photography gave individuals a
glimpse of places they would never otherwise see. Amateur photography
gave them the ability to record their own lives in a way they had
never been able to do before. As author Brian Coe notes, <quote>For the

In this way, the Kodak camera and film were technologies of
expression.  The pencil or paintbrush was also a technology of
expression, of course. But it took years of training before they could
be deployed by amateurs in any useful or effective way. With the
Kodak, expression was possible much sooner and more simply. The
barrier to expression was lowered. Snobs would sneer at its <quote>quality</quote>;
professionals would discount it as irrelevant. But watch a child study
how best to frame a picture and you get a sense of the experience of
creativity that the Kodak enabled. Democratic tools gave ordinary

What was required for this technology to flourish? Obviously,
Eastman's genius was an important part. But also important was the
legal environment within which Eastman's invention grew. For early in
the history of photography, there was a series of judicial decisions
that could well have changed the course of photography substantially.
Courts were asked whether the photographer, amateur or professional,
required permission before he could capture and print whatever image
he wanted. Their answer was no.<footnote><para>

The arguments in favor of requiring permission will sound surprisingly
familiar. The photographer was <quote>taking</quote> something from the person or

On the other side was an argument that should be familiar, as well.
Sure, there may be something of value being used. But citizens should
have the right to capture at least those images that stand in public view.

the rule should be different for images from private spaces.<footnote>

Fortunately for Mr. Eastman, and for photography in general, these
early decisions went in favor of the pirates. In general, no
permission would be required before an image could be captured and
shared with others. Instead, permission was presumed. Freedom was the
default.  (The law would eventually craft an exception for famous
people: commercial photographers who snap pictures of famous people
for commercial purposes have more restrictions than the rest of
us. But in the ordinary case, the image can be captured without
clearing the rights to do the capturing.<footnote><para>

We can only speculate about how photography would have developed had
the law gone the other way. If the presumption had been against the
photographer, then the photographer would have had to demonstrate
permission. Perhaps Eastman Kodak would have had to demonstrate
permission, too, before it developed the film upon which images were
captured. After all, if permission were not granted, then Eastman
Kodak would be benefiting from the <quote>theft</quote> committed by the
photographer. Just as Napster benefited from the copyright
infringements committed by Napster users, Kodak would be benefiting
from the <quote>image-right</quote> infringement of its photographers. We could
imagine the law then requiring that some form of permission be
demonstrated before a company developed pictures. We could imagine a
system developing to demonstrate that permission.

But though we could imagine this system of permission, it would be
very hard to see how photography could have flourished as it did if
the requirement for permission had been built into the rules that
govern it. Photography would have existed. It would have grown in
importance over time. Professionals would have continued to use the
technology as they did&mdash;since professionals could have more
easily borne the burdens of the permission system. But the spread of
photography to ordinary people would not have occurred. Nothing like
that growth would have been realized. And certainly, nothing like that
growth in a democratic technology of expression would have been
realized.

As with any language, this language comes more easily to some than to
others. It doesn't necessarily come more easily to those who excel in
written language. Daley and Stephanie Barish, director of the
Institute for Multimedia Literacy at the Annenberg Center, describe
one particularly poignant example of a project they ran in a high
school.  The high school was a very poor inner-city Los Angeles
school. In all the traditional measures of success, this school was a
failure. But Daley and Barish ran a program that gave kids an
opportunity to use film to express meaning about something the
students know something about&mdash;gun violence.

<indexterm startref='idxdaleyelizabeth' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
The class was held on Friday afternoons, and it created a relatively
new problem for the school. While the challenge in most classes was
getting the kids to come, the challenge in this class was keeping them
away. The <quote>kids were showing up at 6 A.M. and leaving at 5 at night,</quote>
said Barish. They were working harder than in any other class to do
what education should be about&mdash;learning how to express themselves.

Using whatever <quote>free web stuff they could find,</quote> and relatively simple
tools to enable the kids to mix <quote>image, sound, and text,</quote> Barish said
this class produced a series of projects that showed something about
gun violence that few would otherwise understand. This was an issue
close to the lives of these students. The project <quote>gave them a tool
and empowered them to be able to both understand it and talk about
it,</quote> Barish explained. That tool succeeded in creating
expression&mdash;far more successfully and powerfully than could have
been created using only text. <quote>If you had said to these students, <quote>you
have to do it in text,</quote> they would've just thrown their hands up and
gone and done something else,</quote> Barish described, in part, no doubt,
because expressing themselves in text is not something these students
can do well. Yet neither is text a form in which
<emphasis>these</emphasis> ideas can be expressed well. The power of
this message depended upon its connection to this form of expression.

<quote>But isn't education about teaching kids to write?</quote> I asked. In part,
of course, it is. But why are we teaching kids to write? Education,
Daley explained, is about giving students a way of <quote>constructing
meaning.</quote>  To say that that means just writing is like saying teaching
writing is only about teaching kids how to spell. Text is one
part&mdash;and increasingly, not the most powerful part&mdash;of
constructing meaning. As Daley explained in the most moving part of
our interview,

What you want is to give these students ways of constructing

<emphasis role='strong'>When two planes</emphasis> crashed into the
World Trade Center, another into the Pentagon, and a fourth into a
Pennsylvania field, all media around the world shifted to this
news. Every moment of just about every day for that week, and for
weeks after, television in particular, and media generally, retold the
story of the events we had just witnessed. The telling was a
retelling, because we had seen the events that were described. The
genius of this awful act of terrorism was that the delayed second
attack was perfectly timed to assure that the whole world would be
watching.

These retellings had an increasingly familiar feel. There was music
scored for the intermissions, and fancy graphics that flashed across

But in addition to this produced news about the <quote>tragedy of September
11,</quote> those of us tied to the Internet came to see a very different
production as well. The Internet was filled with accounts of the same
events. Yet these Internet accounts had a very different flavor. Some
people constructed photo pages that captured images from around the
world and presented them as slide shows with text. Some offered open
letters. There were sound recordings. There was anger and frustration.
There were attempts to provide context. There was, in short, an
extraordinary worldwide barn raising, in the sense Mike Godwin uses
the term in his book <citetitle>Cyber Rights</citetitle>, around a news event that had
captured the attention of the world. There was ABC and CBS, but there
was also the Internet.

I don't mean simply to praise the Internet&mdash;though I do think the
people who supported this form of speech should be praised. I mean
instead to point to a significance in this form of speech. For like a
Kodak, the Internet enables people to capture images. And like in a
movie
<!-- PAGE BREAK 54 -->
by a student on the <quote>Just Think!</quote> bus, the visual images could be mixed
with sound or text.

But unlike any technology for simply capturing images, the Internet
allows these creations to be shared with an extraordinary number of
people, practically instantaneously. This is something new in our
tradition&mdash;not just that culture can be captured mechanically,
and obviously not just that events are commented upon critically, but
that this mix of captured images, sound, and commentary can be widely
spread practically instantaneously.

September 11 was not an aberration. It was a beginning. Around the
same time, a form of communication that has grown dramatically was
just beginning to come into public consciousness: the Web-log, or
blog. The blog is a kind of public diary, and within some cultures,
such as in Japan, it functions very much like a diary. In those
cultures, it records private facts in a public way&mdash;it's a kind

But in the United States, blogs have taken on a very different
character.  There are some who use the space simply to talk about
their private life. But there are many who use the space to engage in
public discourse. Discussing matters of public import, criticizing
others who are mistaken in their views, criticizing politicians about
the decisions they make, offering solutions to problems we all see:
blogs create the sense of a virtual public meeting, but one in which
we don't all hope to be there at the same time and in which
conversations are not necessarily linked. The best of the blog entries
are relatively short; they point directly to words used by others,
criticizing with or adding to them.  They are arguably the most
important form of unchoreographed public discourse that we have.

That's a strong statement. Yet it says as much about our democracy as

people vote

in those elections. The cycle of these elections has become totally

But democracy has never just been about elections. Democracy
means rule by the people, but rule means something more than mere
elections. In our tradition, it also means control through reasoned
discourse.  This was the idea that captured the imagination of Alexis
de Tocqueville, the nineteenth-century French lawyer who wrote the
most important account of early <quote>Democracy in America.</quote> It wasn't
popular elections that fascinated him&mdash;it was the jury, an
institution that gave ordinary people the right to choose life or
death for other citizens.  And most fascinating for him was that the
jury didn't just vote about the outcome they would impose. They
deliberated. Members argued about the <quote>right</quote> result; they tried to
persuade each other of the <quote>right</quote> result, and in criminal cases at
least, they had to agree upon a unanimous result for the process to
come to an end.<footnote><para>

More bizarrely, there is generally not even permission for it to

Enter the blog. The blog's very architecture solves one part of this
problem. People post when they want to post, and people read when they
want to read. The most difficult time is synchronous time.
Technologies that enable asynchronous communication, such as e-mail,
increase the opportunity for communication. Blogs allow for public

<!-- PAGE BREAK 56 -->
discourse without the public ever needing to gather in a single public
place.
</para>
<para>
But beyond architecture, blogs also have solved the problem of
norms. There's no norm (yet) in blog space not to talk about politics.
Indeed, the space is filled with political speech, on both the right and
the left. Some of the most popular sites are conservative or libertarian,
but there are many of all political stripes. And even blogs that are not
political cover political issues when the occasion merits.

One direct effect is on stories that had a different life cycle in the

<quote>misspoke</quote> at a party for Senator Strom Thurmond, essentially praising
Thurmond's segregationist policies, he calculated correctly that this
story would disappear from the mainstream press within forty-eight
hours. It did. But he didn't calculate its life cycle in blog
space. The bloggers kept researching the story. Over time, more and
more instances of the same <quote>misspeaking</quote> emerged. Finally, the story
broke back into the mainstream press. In the end, Lott was forced to
resign as senate majority leader.<footnote><para>

This different cycle is possible because the same commercial pressures
don't exist with blogs as with other ventures. Television and

But bloggers don't have a similar constraint. They can obsess, they
can focus, they can get serious. If a particular blogger writes a
particularly interesting story, more and more people link to that
story. And as the number of links to a particular story increases, it
rises in the ranks of stories. People read what is popular; what is
popular has been selected by a very democratic process of
peer-generated rankings.

There's a second way, as well, in which blogs have a different cycle

It also needs to sustain a more coherent account. (In the middle of
the Iraq war, I read a post on the Internet from someone who was at
that time listening to a satellite uplink with a reporter in Iraq. The
New York headquarters was telling the reporter over and over that her
account of the war was too bleak: She needed to offer a more
optimistic story. When she told New York that wasn't warranted, they
told her that <emphasis>they</emphasis> were writing <quote>the story.</quote>)

Blog space gives amateurs a way to enter the
debate&mdash;<quote>amateur</quote> not in the sense of inexperienced,
but in the sense of an Olympic athlete, meaning not paid by anyone to
give their reports. It allows for a much broader range of input into a
story, as reporting on the Columbia disaster revealed, when hundreds
from across the southwest United States turned to the Internet to
retell what they had seen.<footnote><para>

And it drives readers to read across the range of accounts and

But it is clear that we are still in transition. <quote>A

lot of what we are doing now is warm-up exercises,</quote> Winer told me.
There is a lot that must mature before this space has its mature effect.

<para>
This speech affects democracy. Winer thinks that happens because <quote>you
don't have to work for somebody who controls, [for] a gatekeeper.</quote>
That is true. But it affects democracy in another way as well.  As
more and more citizens express what they think, and defend it in
writing, that will change the way people understand public issues. It
is easy to be wrong and misguided in your head. It is harder when the
product of your mind can be criticized by others. Of course, it is a
rare human who admits that he has been persuaded that he is wrong. But
it is even rarer for a human to ignore when he has been proven wrong.
The writing of ideas, arguments, and criticism improves democracy.
Today there are probably a couple of million blogs where such writing
happens. When there are ten million, there will be something
extraordinary to report.

</para>
<para>
Brown thus looks at these technologies of digital creativity a bit
differently from the perspectives I've sketched so far. I'm sure he
would be excited about any technology that might improve
democracy. But his real excitement comes from how these technologies
affect learning.
</para>
<para>
As Brown believes, we learn by tinkering. When <quote>a lot of us grew up,</quote>
he explains, that tinkering was done <quote>on motorcycle engines, lawnmower
engines, automobiles, radios, and so on.</quote> But digital technologies
enable a different kind of tinkering&mdash;with abstract ideas though
in concrete form. The kids at Just Think! not only think about how a
commercial portrays a politician; using digital technology, they can
<!-- PAGE BREAK 59 -->
take the commercial apart and manipulate it, tinker with it to see how
it does what it does. Digital technologies launch a kind of bricolage,
or <quote>free collage,</quote> as Brown calls it. Many get to add to or transform
the tinkering of many others.
</para>
<para>
The best large-scale example of this kind of tinkering so far is free
software or open-source software (FS/OSS). FS/OSS is software whose
source code is shared. Anyone can download the technology that makes a
FS/OSS program run. And anyone eager to learn how a particular bit of
FS/OSS technology works can tinker with the code.
</para>
<para>
This opportunity creates a <quote>completely new kind of learning platform,</quote>
as Brown describes. <quote>As soon as you start doing that, you &hellip;
unleash a free collage on the community, so that other people can
start looking at your code, tinkering with it, trying it out, seeing
if they can improve it.</quote> Each effort is a kind of
apprenticeship. <quote>Open source becomes a major apprenticeship platform.</quote>
</para>
<para>
In this process, <quote>the concrete things you tinker with are abstract.
They are code.</quote> Kids are <quote>shifting to the ability to tinker in the
abstract, and this tinkering is no longer an isolated activity that
you're doing in your garage. You are tinkering with a community
platform. &hellip;  You are tinkering with other people's stuff. The more
you tinker the more you improve.</quote> The more you improve, the more you
learn.
</para>
<para>
This same thing happens with content, too. And it happens in the same
collaborative way when that content is part of the Web. As Brown puts
it, <quote>the Web [is] the first medium that truly honors multiple forms of
intelligence.</quote> Earlier technologies, such as the typewriter or word
processors, helped amplify text. But the Web amplifies much more than
text. <quote>The Web &hellip; says if you are musical, if you are artistic, if
you are visual, if you are interested in film &hellip; [then] there is a
lot you can start to do on this medium. [It] can now amplify and honor
these multiple forms of intelligence.</quote>

kind of recognition.
</para>
<para>
Yet the freedom to tinker with these objects is not guaranteed.
Indeed, as we'll see through the course of this book, that freedom is
increasingly highly contested. While there's no doubt that your father
had the right to tinker with the car engine, there's great doubt that
your child will have the right to tinker with the images she finds all
around.  The law and, increasingly, technology interfere with a
freedom that technology, and curiosity, would otherwise ensure.
</para>
<para>
These restrictions have become the focus of researchers and scholars.
Professor Ed Felten of Princeton (whom we'll see more of in chapter
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="property-i"/>)
has developed a powerful argument in favor of the <quote>right to
tinker</quote> as it applies to computer science and to knowledge in
general.<footnote><para>

Control Interferes with Noninfringing Scholarship,</quote> <citetitle>Communications

But Brown's concern is earlier, or younger, or more fundamental. It is
about the learning that kids can do, or can't do, because of the law.
</para>
<para>
<quote>This is where education in the twenty-first century is going,</quote> Brown
explains. We need to <quote>understand how kids who grow up digital think
and want to learn.</quote>
</para>
<para>
<quote>Yet,</quote> as Brown continued, and as the balance of this book will
evince, <quote>we are building a legal system that completely suppresses the
natural tendencies of today's digital kids. &hellip; We're building an
architecture that unleashes 60 percent of the brain [and] a legal
system that closes down that part of the brain.</quote>

We're building a technology that takes the magic of Kodak, mixes

These engines are enabled by the network technology itself.
Microsoft, for example, has a network file system that makes it very
easy for search engines tuned to that network to query the system for
information about the publicly (within that network) available
content.  Jesse's search engine was built to take advantage of this
technology. It used Microsoft's network file system to build an index
of all the files available within the RPI network.

<para>
Jesse's wasn't the first search engine built for the RPI network.
Indeed, his engine was a simple modification of engines that others
had built. His single most important improvement over those engines
was to fix a bug within the Microsoft file-sharing system that could
cause a user's computer to crash. With the engines that existed
before, if you tried to access a file through a Windows browser that
was on a computer that was off-line, your computer could crash. Jesse
modified the system a bit to fix that problem, by adding a button that
a user could click to see if the machine holding the file was still
on-line.

Jesse's engine went on-line in late October. Over the following six
months, he continued to tweak it to improve its functionality. By

million files in his directory, including every type of content that might
be on users' computers.

Thus the index his search engine produced included pictures, which
students could use to put on their own Web sites; copies of notes or

put music files in their public folders. He did nothing to target the
search engine to these files. He was a kid tinkering with a
Google-like technology at a university where he was studying
information science, and hence, tinkering was the aim. Unlike Google,
or Microsoft, for that matter, he made no money from this tinkering;
he was not connected to any business that would make any money from
this experiment. He was a kid tinkering with technology in an
environment where tinkering with technology was precisely what he was
supposed to do.

On April 3, 2003, Jesse was contacted by the dean of students at
RPI. The dean informed Jesse that the Recording Industry Association
of America, the RIAA, would be filing a lawsuit against him and three
other students whom he didn't even know, two of them at other
universities.  A few hours later, Jesse was served with papers from
the suit.  As he read these papers and watched the news reports about
them, he was increasingly astonished.

The RIAA wanted Jesse to admit to doing something wrong. He

technology for the rest of his life. He refused. They made him
understand that this process of being sued was not going to be
pleasant. (As Jesse's father recounted to me, the chief lawyer on the
case, Matt Oppenheimer, told Jesse, <quote>You don't want to pay another
visit to a dentist like me.</quote>) And throughout, the RIAA insisted it
would not settle the case until it took every penny Jesse had saved.

But Jesse's uncle worked to educate the family about the nature of the

win. But the cost of fighting a lawsuit like this, Jesse was told, would be
at least $250,000. If he won, he would not recover that money. If he

won, he would have a piece of paper saying he had won, and a piece of

With the country experiencing a tremendous expansion in the number of

by forming a strong-arm subsidiary known as the General Film Company
to block the entry of non-licensed independents. With coercive tactics
that have become legendary, General Film confiscated unlicensed
equipment, discontinued product supply to theaters which showed
unlicensed films, and effectively monopolized distribution with the
acquisition of all U.S. film exchanges, except for the one owned by
the independent William Fox who defied the Trust even after his

At the time that Edison and Henri Fourneaux invented machines
for reproducing music (Edison the phonograph, Fourneaux the player

their music and the exclusive right to control public performances of
their music. In other words, in 1900, if I wanted a copy of Phil Russel's

But what if I wanted to record <quote>Happy Mose,</quote> using Edison's phonograph

enough that I would have to buy any copy of the musical score that I
performed in making this recording. And it was clear enough that I
would have to pay for any public performance of the work I was
recording.  But it wasn't totally clear that I would have to pay for a
<quote>public performance</quote> if I recorded the song in my own house (even
today, you don't owe the Beatles anything if you sing their songs in
the shower), or if I recorded the song from memory (copies in your
brain are not&mdash;yet&mdash; regulated by copyright law). So if I
simply sang the song into a recording device in the privacy of my own
home, it wasn't clear that I owed the composer anything. And more
importantly, it wasn't clear whether I owed the composer anything if I
then made copies of those recordings.  Because of this gap in the law,
then, I could effectively pirate someone else's song without paying
its composer anything.

This is an exception within the law of copyright. When John Grisham

Grisham gives the publisher permission. Grisham, in turn, is free to

Grisham is thus set by Grisham, and copyright law ordinarily says you

Grisham.

But the law governing recordings gives recording artists less. And

weaker right than it otherwise gives creative authors. The Beatles
have less control over their creative work than Grisham does. And the
beneficiaries of this less control are the recording industry and the
public. The recording industry gets something of value for less than
it otherwise would pay; the public gets access to a much wider range
of musical creativity. Indeed, Congress was quite explicit about its
reasons for granting this right. Its fear was the monopoly power of
rights holders, and that that power would stifle follow-on

While the recording industry has been quite coy about this recently,

the record producers argued vigorously that the compulsory

license system must be retained. They asserted that the record
industry is a half-billion-dollar business of great economic
importance in the United States and throughout the world; records
today are the principal means of disseminating music, and this creates
special problems, since performers need unhampered access to musical
material on nondiscriminatory terms. Historically, the record
producers pointed out, there were no recording rights before 1909 and
the 1909 statute adopted the compulsory license as a deliberate
anti-monopoly condition on the grant of these rights. They argue that
the result has been an outpouring of recorded music, with the public
being given lower prices, improved quality, and a greater
choice.<footnote><para>

When a radio station plays a record on the air, that constitutes a
<quote>public performance</quote> of the composer's work.<footnote><para>
<!-- f12 -->
See 17 <citetitle>United States Code</citetitle>, sections 106 and 110. At the beginning,
record companies printed <quote>Not Licensed for Radio Broadcast</quote> and other
messages purporting to restrict the ability to play a record on a
radio station.  Judge Learned Hand rejected the argument that a
warning attached to a record might restrict the rights of the radio
station. See <citetitle>RCA Manufacturing Co</citetitle>. v. <citetitle>Whiteman</citetitle>, 114 F. 2d 86 (2nd
Cir. 1940). See also Randal C.  Picker, <quote>From Edison to the Broadcast

As I described above, the law gives the composer (or copyright holder)
an exclusive right to public performances of his work. The radio
station thus owes the composer money for that performance.
</para>
<indexterm id='idxradiomusicrecordingsplayedon' class='startofrange'><primary>radio</primary><secondary>music recordings played on</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
But when the radio station plays a record, it is not only performing a
copy of the <emphasis>composer's</emphasis> work. The radio station is
also performing a copy of the <emphasis>recording artist's</emphasis>
work. It's one thing to have <quote>Happy Birthday</quote> sung on the radio by the
local children's choir; it's quite another to have it sung by the
Rolling Stones or Lyle Lovett. The recording artist is adding to the
value of the composition performed on the radio station.  And if the
law were perfectly consistent, the radio station would have to pay the
recording artist for his work, just as it pays the composer of the
music for his work.
<indexterm><primary>Lovett, Lyle</primary></indexterm>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 72 -->
</para>
<para>
But it doesn't. Under the law governing radio performances, the radio
station does not have to pay the recording artist. The radio station
need only pay the composer. The radio station thus gets a bit of
something for nothing. It gets to perform the recording artist's work
for free, even if it must pay the composer something for the privilege
of playing the song.
</para>
<indexterm id='idxmadonna' class='startofrange'><primary>Madonna</primary></indexterm>
<para>
This difference can be huge. Imagine you compose a piece of music.
Imagine it is your first. You own the exclusive right to authorize
public performances of that music. So if Madonna wants to sing your
song in public, she has to get your permission.
</para>
<para>
Imagine she does sing your song, and imagine she likes it a lot. She
then decides to make a recording of your song, and it becomes a top
hit. Under our law, every time a radio station plays your song, you
get some money. But Madonna gets nothing, save the indirect effect on
the sale of her CDs. The public performance of her recording is not a
<quote>protected</quote> right. The radio station thus gets to
<emphasis>pirate</emphasis> the value of Madonna's work without paying
her anything.

No doubt, one might argue that, on balance, the recording artists
benefit. On average, the promotion they get is worth more than the
performance rights they give up. Maybe. But even if so, the law
ordinarily gives the creator the right to make this choice. By making
the choice for him or her, the law gives the radio station the right
to take something for nothing.

cable companies would have to pay for the content that they broadcast;
but the price they would have to pay was not set by the copyright

All across the world, but especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, there
are businesses that do nothing but take others people's copyrighted

owner. The recording industry estimates that it loses about $4.6 billion
every year to physical piracy<footnote><para>

(that works out to one in three CDs sold worldwide). The MPAA
estimates that it loses $3 billion annually worldwide to piracy.
</para>
<para>
This is piracy plain and simple. Nothing in the argument of this
book, nor in the argument that most people make when talking about
the subject of this book, should draw into doubt this simple point:
This piracy is wrong.
</para>
<para>
Which is not to say that excuses and justifications couldn't be made
for it. We could, for example, remind ourselves that for the first one
hundred years of the American Republic, America did not honor foreign
copyrights. We were born, in this sense, a pirate nation. It might
therefore seem hypocritical for us to insist so strongly that other
developing nations treat as wrong what we, for the first hundred years
of our existence, treated as right.
</para>
<para>
That excuse isn't terribly strong. Technically, our law did not ban
the taking of foreign works. It explicitly limited itself to American
works. Thus the American publishers who published foreign works
without the permission of foreign authors were not violating any rule.
The copy shops in Asia, by contrast, are violating Asian law. Asian
law does protect foreign copyrights, and the actions of the copy shops
violate that law. So the wrong of piracy that they engage in is not
just a moral wrong, but a legal wrong, and not just an internationally
legal wrong, but a locally legal wrong as well.
</para>
<para>
True, these local rules have, in effect, been imposed upon these
countries. No country can be part of the world economy and choose
<!-- PAGE BREAK 77-->
not to protect copyright internationally. We may have been born a
pirate nation, but we will not allow any other nation to have a
similar childhood.
</para>
<para>
If a country is to be treated as a sovereign, however, then its laws are
its laws regardless of their source. The international law under which
these nations live gives them some opportunities to escape the burden
of intellectual property law.<footnote><para>
<!-- f2 -->
See Peter Drahos with John Braithwaite, Information Feudalism:
<citetitle>Who Owns the Knowledge Economy?</citetitle> (New York: The
New Press, 2003), 10&ndash;13, 209.  The Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement obligates member
nations to create administrative and enforcement mechanisms for
intellectual property rights, a costly proposition for developing
countries. Additionally, patent rights may lead to higher prices for
staple industries such as agriculture. Critics of TRIPS question the
disparity between burdens imposed upon developing countries and
benefits conferred to industrialized nations. TRIPS does permit
governments to use patents for public, noncommercial uses without
first obtaining the patent holder's permission. Developing nations may
be able to use this to gain the benefits of foreign patents at lower
prices. This is a promising strategy for developing nations within the
TRIPS framework.

Alternatively, we could try to excuse this piracy by noting that in
any case, it does no harm to the industry. The Chinese who get access
to American CDs at 50 cents a copy are not people who would have
bought those American CDs at $15 a copy. So no one really has any
less money than they otherwise would have had.<footnote><para>

For an analysis of the economic impact of copying technology, see Stan
Liebowitz, <citetitle>Rethinking the Network Economy</citetitle> (New York: Amacom, 2002),
144&ndash;90. <quote>In some instances &hellip; the impact of piracy on the
copyright holder's ability to appropriate the value of the work will
be negligible. One obvious instance is the case where the individual
engaging in pirating would not have purchased an original even if
pirating were not an option.</quote> Ibid., 149.

This is often true (though I have friends who have purchased many
thousands of pirated DVDs who certainly have enough money to pay
for the content they have taken), and it does mitigate to some degree
the harm caused by such taking. Extremists in this debate love to say,
<quote>You wouldn't go into Barnes &amp; Noble and take a book off of the shelf
without paying; why should it be any different with on-line music?</quote>
The difference is, of course, that when you take a book from Barnes &amp;
Noble, it has one less book to sell. By contrast, when you take an MP3
from a computer network, there is not one less CD that can be sold.
The physics of piracy of the intangible are different from the physics of
piracy of the tangible.

<indexterm startref='idxcdsforeign' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
This argument is still very weak. However, although copyright is a
property right of a very special sort, it <emphasis>is</emphasis> a
property right. Like all property rights, the copyright gives the
owner the right to decide the terms under which content is shared. If
the copyright owner doesn't want to sell, she doesn't have to. There
are exceptions: important statutory licenses that apply to copyrighted
content regardless of the wish of the copyright owner. Those licenses
give people the right to <quote>take</quote> copyrighted content whether or not the
copyright owner wants to sell. But

<!-- PAGE BREAK 78 -->
where the law does not give people the right to take content, it is
wrong to take that content even if the wrong does no harm. If we have
a property system, and that system is properly balanced to the
technology of a time, then it is wrong to take property without the
permission of a property owner. That is exactly what <quote>property</quote> means.

Finally, we could try to excuse this piracy with the argument that the
piracy actually helps the copyright owner. When the Chinese <quote>steal</quote>
Windows, that makes the Chinese dependent on Microsoft.  Microsoft
loses the value of the software that was taken. But it gains users who
are used to life in the Microsoft world. Over time, as the nation
grows more wealthy, more and more people will buy software rather than
steal it. And hence over time, because that buying will benefit
Microsoft, Microsoft benefits from the piracy. If instead of pirating
Microsoft Windows, the Chinese used the free GNU/Linux operating
system, then these Chinese users would not eventually be buying
Microsoft.  Without piracy, then, Microsoft would lose.

This argument, too, is somewhat true. The addiction strategy is a good
one. Many businesses practice it. Some thrive because of it. Law
students, for example, are given free access to the two largest legal
databases. The companies marketing both hope the students will become
so used to their service that they will want to use it and not the
other when they become lawyers (and must pay high subscription fees).

Still, the argument is not terribly persuasive. We don't give the
alcoholic a defense when he steals his first beer, merely because that
will make it more likely that he will buy the next three. Instead, we
ordinarily allow businesses to decide for themselves when it is best
to give their product away. If Microsoft fears the competition of
GNU/Linux, then Microsoft can give its product away, as it did, for
example, with Internet Explorer to fight Netscape. A property right
means giving the property owner the right to say who gets access to
what&mdash;at least ordinarily. And if the law properly balances the
rights of the copyright owner with the rights of access, then
violating the law is still wrong.

<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 79 -->
Thus, while I understand the pull of these justifications for piracy,
and I certainly see the motivation, in my view, in the end, these efforts
at justifying commercial piracy simply don't cut it. This kind of piracy
is rampant and just plain wrong. It doesn't transform the content it
steals; it doesn't transform the market it competes in. It merely gives
someone access to something that the law says he should not have.
Nothing has changed to draw that law into doubt. This form of piracy
is flat out wrong.
</para>
<para>
But as the examples from the four chapters that introduced this part
suggest, even if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all <quote>piracy</quote> is. Or
at least, not all <quote>piracy</quote> is wrong if that term is understood in the
way it is increasingly used today. Many kinds of <quote>piracy</quote> are useful
and productive, to produce either new content or new ways of doing
business.  Neither our tradition nor any tradition has ever banned all
<quote>piracy</quote> in that sense of the term.
</para>
<para>
This doesn't mean that there are no questions raised by the latest
piracy concern, peer-to-peer file sharing. But it does mean that we
need to understand the harm in peer-to-peer sharing a bit more before
we condemn it to the gallows with the charge of piracy.
</para>
<para>
For (1) like the original Hollywood, p2p sharing escapes an overly
controlling industry; and (2) like the original recording industry, it
simply exploits a new way to distribute content; but (3) unlike cable
TV, no one is selling the content that is shared on p2p services.

These differences distinguish p2p sharing from true piracy. They
should push us to find a way to protect artists while enabling this
sharing to survive.

everyone who takes it would actually have bought it if sharing didn't
make it available for free. Most probably wouldn't have, but clearly
there are some who would.  The latter are the target of category A:
users who download instead of purchasing.

There are some who use sharing networks to sample music before
purchasing it. Thus, a friend sends another friend an MP3 of an artist
he's not heard of. The other friend then buys CDs by that artist. This
is a kind of targeted advertising, quite likely to succeed.  If the
friend recommending the album gains nothing from a bad recommendation,
then one could expect that the recommendations will actually be quite
good. The net effect of this sharing could increase the quantity of
music purchased.

There are many who use sharing networks to get access to copyrighted
content that is no longer sold or that they would not have purchased
because the transaction costs off the Net are too high. This use of
sharing networks is among the most rewarding for many. Songs that were
part of your childhood but have long vanished from the marketplace
magically appear again on the network. (One friend told me that when
she discovered Napster, she spent a solid weekend <quote>recalling</quote> old
songs. She was astonished at the range and mix of content that was
available.)  For content not sold, this is still technically a
violation of copyright, though because the copyright owner is not
selling the content anymore, the economic harm is zero&mdash;the same
harm that occurs when I sell my collection of 1960s 45-rpm records to
a local collector.

How do these different types of sharing balance out?

<para>
Let's start with some simple but important points. From the
perspective of the law, only type D sharing is clearly legal. From the
perspective of economics, only type A sharing is clearly
harmful.<footnote><para>

Type B sharing is illegal but plainly beneficial. Type C sharing is
illegal, yet good for society (since more exposure to music is good)
and harmless to the artist (since the work is not otherwise
available). So how sharing matters on balance is a hard question to
answer&mdash;and certainly much more difficult than the current
rhetoric around the issue suggests.
</para>
<para>
Whether on balance sharing is harmful depends importantly on how
harmful type A sharing is. Just as Edison complained about Hollywood,
composers complained about piano rolls, recording artists complained
about radio, and broadcasters complained about cable TV, the music
industry complains that type A sharing is a kind of <quote>theft</quote> that is
<quote>devastating</quote> the industry.

While the numbers do suggest that sharing is harmful, how
harmful is harder to reckon. It has long been the recording industry's
practice to blame technology for any drop in sales. The history of
cassette recording is a good example. As a study by Cap Gemini Ernst

See Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, <citetitle>Technology Evolution and the
Music Industry's Business Model Crisis</citetitle> (2003), 3. This report
describes the music industry's effort to stigmatize the budding
practice of cassette taping in the 1970s, including an advertising
campaign featuring a cassette-shape skull and the caption <quote>Home taping

the Office of Technical Assessment conducted a survey of consumer

The labels claimed that every album taped was an album unsold, and

But just because the industry was wrong before does not mean it is
wrong today. To evaluate the real threat that p2p sharing presents to
the industry in particular, and society in general&mdash;or at least
the society that inherits the tradition that gave us the film
industry, the record industry, the radio industry, cable TV, and the
VCR&mdash;the question is not simply whether type A sharing is
harmful. The question is also <emphasis>how</emphasis> harmful type A
sharing is, and how beneficial the other types of sharing are.
</para>
<para>
We start to answer this question by focusing on the net harm, from the
standpoint of the industry as a whole, that sharing networks cause.
The <quote>net harm</quote> to the industry as a whole is the amount by which type
A sharing exceeds type B. If the record companies sold more records
through sampling than they lost through substitution, then sharing
networks would actually benefit music companies on balance. They would
therefore have little <emphasis>static</emphasis> reason to resist
them.

In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 percent,
from 882 million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7

This confirms a trend over the past few years. The RIAA blames
Internet piracy for the trend, though there are many other causes that
could account for this drop. SoundScan, for example, reports a more
than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released since 1999. That no
doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales. Rising prices could
account for at least some of the loss. <quote>From 1999 to 2001, the average

But let's assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD sales
is because of Internet sharing. Here's the rub: In the same period
that the RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA
estimates that 2.1 billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus,
although 2.6 times the total number of CDs sold were downloaded for
free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7 percent.
</para>
<para>
There are too many different things happening at the same time to
explain these numbers definitively, but one conclusion is unavoidable:
The recording industry constantly asks, <quote>What's the difference between
downloading a song and stealing a CD?</quote>&mdash;but their own numbers
reveal the difference. If I steal a CD, then there is one less CD to
sell. Every taking is a lost sale. But on the basis of the numbers the
RIAA provides, it is absolutely clear that the same is not true of
downloads. If every download were a lost sale&mdash;if every use of
Kazaa <quote>rob[bed] the author of [his] profit</quote>&mdash;then the industry
would have suffered a 100 percent drop in sales last year, not a 7
percent drop. If 2.6 times the number of CDs sold were downloaded for
free, and yet sales revenue dropped by just 6.7 percent, then there is
a huge difference between <quote>downloading a song and stealing a CD.</quote>
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxcdssales' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
These are the harms&mdash;alleged and perhaps exaggerated but, let's
assume, real. What of the benefits? File sharing may impose costs on
the recording industry. What value does it produce in addition to
these costs?
</para>
<para>
One benefit is type C sharing&mdash;making available content that
is technically still under copyright but is no longer commercially
available.  This is not a small category of content. There are
millions of tracks that are no longer commercially
available.<footnote><para>

is no longer in print. See Online Entertainment and Copyright

And while it's conceivable that some of this content is not available

In real space&mdash;long before the Internet&mdash;the market had a simple

response to this problem: used book and record stores. There are
thousands of used book and used record stores in America
today.<footnote><para>

While there are not good estimates of the number of used record stores

Press, <citetitle>The Quiet Revolution: The Expansion of the Used Book

</para></footnote>
These stores buy content from owners, then sell the content they
buy. And under American copyright law, when they buy and sell this
content, <emphasis>even if the content is still under
copyright</emphasis>, the copyright owner doesn't get a dime. Used
book and record stores are commercial entities; their owners make
money from the content they sell; but as with cable companies before
statutory licensing, they don't have to pay the copyright owner for
the content they sell.

Type C sharing, then, is very much like used book stores or used
record stores. It is different, of course, because the person making
the content available isn't making money from making the content
available.  It is also different, of course, because in real space,
when I sell a record, I don't have it anymore, while in cyberspace,
when someone shares my 1949 recording of Bernstein's <quote>Two Love Songs,</quote>
I still have it. That difference would matter economically if the
owner of the copyright were selling the record in competition to my
sharing. But we're talking about the class of content that is not
currently commercially available. The Internet is making it available,
through cooperative sharing, without competing with the market.
</para>
<para>
It may well be, all things considered, that it would be better if the
copyright owner got something from this trade. But just because it may
well be better, it doesn't follow that it would be good to ban used book
stores. Or put differently, if you think that type C sharing should be
stopped, do you think that libraries and used book stores should be
shut as well?

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, file-sharing networks enable
type D sharing to occur&mdash;the sharing of content that copyright owners
want to have shared or for which there is no continuing copyright. This
sharing clearly benefits authors and society. Science fiction author
Cory Doctorow, for example, released his first novel, <citetitle>Down and Out in
the Magic Kingdom</citetitle>, both free on-line and in bookstores on the same

day. His (and his publisher's) thinking was that the on-line distribution
would be a great advertisement for the <quote>real</quote> book. People would read
part on-line, and then decide whether they liked the book or not. If
they liked it, they would be more likely to buy it. Doctorow's content is
type D content. If sharing networks enable his work to be spread, then
both he and society are better off. (Actually, much better off: It is a
great book!)
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxbooksfreeonline1' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
Likewise for work in the public domain: This sharing benefits society
with no legal harm to authors at all. If efforts to solve the problem
of type A sharing destroy the opportunity for type D sharing, then we
lose something important in order to protect type A content.
</para>
<para>
The point throughout is this: While the recording industry
understandably says, <quote>This is how much we've lost,</quote> we must also ask,
<quote>How much has society gained from p2p sharing? What are the
efficiencies?  What is the content that otherwise would be
unavailable?</quote>
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxinternetbookson' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
For unlike the piracy I described in the first section of this
chapter, much of the <quote>piracy</quote> that file sharing enables is plainly
legal and good.  And like the piracy I described in chapter
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="pirates"/>, much of
this piracy is motivated by a new way of spreading content caused by
changes in the technology of distribution. Thus, consistent with the
tradition that gave us Hollywood, radio, the recording industry, and
cable TV, the question we should be asking about file sharing is how
best to preserve its benefits while minimizing (to the extent
possible) the wrongful harm it causes artists. The question is one of
balance. The law should seek that balance, and that balance will be
found only with time.

You would think. And we should hope. But so far, it is not. The effect
of the war purportedly on type A sharing alone has been felt far
beyond that one class of sharing. That much is obvious from the
Napster case itself. When Napster told the district court that it had
developed a technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of

If 99.4 percent is not good enough, then this is a war on file-sharing
technologies, not a war on copyright infringement. There is no way to
assure that a p2p system is used 100 percent of the time in compliance
with the law, any more than there is a way to assure that 100 percent of
VCRs or 100 percent of Xerox machines or 100 percent of handguns
are used in compliance with the law. Zero tolerance means zero p2p.
The court's ruling means that we as a society must lose the benefits of
p2p, even for the totally legal and beneficial uses they serve, simply to
assure that there are zero copyright infringements caused by p2p.

<para>
Zero tolerance has not been our history. It has not produced the
content industry that we know today. The history of American law has
been a process of balance. As new technologies changed the way content
was distributed, the law adjusted, after some time, to the new
technology.  In this adjustment, the law sought to ensure the
legitimate rights of creators while protecting innovation. Sometimes
this has meant more rights for creators. Sometimes less.

This compromise, like the compromise affecting records and player

of any copyright legislation. First, the law assured that new
innovators would have the freedom to develop new ways to deliver
content.  Second, the law assured that copyright holders would be paid
for the content that was distributed. One fear was that if Congress
simply required cable TV to pay copyright holders whatever they
demanded for their content, then copyright holders associated with
broadcasters would use their power to stifle this new technology,
cable. But if Congress had permitted cable to use broadcasters'
content for free, then it would have unfairly subsidized cable. Thus
Congress chose a path that would assure
<emphasis>compensation</emphasis> without giving the past

In the same year that Congress struck this balance, two major
producers and distributors of film content filed a lawsuit against
another technology, the video tape recorder (VTR, or as we refer to
them today, VCRs) that Sony had produced, the Betamax. Disney's and
Universal's claim against Sony was relatively simple: Sony produced a
device, Disney and Universal claimed, that enabled consumers to engage
in copyright infringement. Because the device that Sony built had a
<quote>record</quote> button, the device could be used to record copyrighted movies
and shows. Sony was therefore benefiting from the copyright
infringement of its customers. It should therefore, Disney and
Universal claimed, be partially liable for that infringement.

There was something to Disney's and Universal's claim. Sony did
decide to design its machine to make it very simple to record television
shows. It could have built the machine to block or inhibit any direct
copying from a television broadcast. Or possibly, it could have built the
machine to copy only if there were a special <quote>copy me</quote> signal on the
line. It was clear that there were many television shows that did not
grant anyone permission to copy. Indeed, if anyone had asked, no
doubt the majority of shows would not have authorized copying. And
<!-- PAGE BREAK 89 -->
in the face of this obvious preference, Sony could have designed its
system to minimize the opportunity for copyright infringement. It did
not, and for that, Disney and Universal wanted to hold it responsible
for the architecture it chose.

<emphasis role='strong'>The copyright warriors</emphasis> are right: A
copyright is a kind of property. It can be owned and sold, and the law

But in ordinary language, to call a copyright a <quote>property</quote> right is a
bit misleading, for the property of copyright is an odd kind of
property.  Indeed, the very idea of property in any idea or any
expression is very odd. I understand what I am taking when I take the

As the legal realists taught American law, all property rights are
intangible.  A property right is simply a right that an individual has
against the world to do or not do certain things that may or may not
attach to a physical object. The right itself is intangible, even if
the object to which it is (metaphorically) attached is tangible. See

these stories, the significance of this true

The reason is that the English hadn't yet agreed on what a <quote>copyright</quote>
was&mdash;indeed, no one had. At the time the English passed the
Statute of Anne, there was no other legislation governing copyrights.
The last law regulating publishers, the Licensing Act of 1662, had
expired in 1695. That law gave publishers a monopoly over publishing,
as a way to make it easier for the Crown to control what was
published.  But after it expired, there was no positive law that said
that the publishers, or <quote>Stationers,</quote> had an exclusive right to print
books.

from legislatures <quote>positive law.</quote> We call the words from judges
<quote>common law.</quote> The common law sets the background against which
legislatures legislate; the legislature, ordinarily, can trump that
background only if it passes a law to displace it. And so the real
question after the licensing statutes had expired was whether the
common law protected a copyright, independent of any positive law.

<para>
For the booksellers, and the authors whom they represented, had a very
strong claim. Take <citetitle>Romeo and Juliet</citetitle> as an example: That play
was written by Shakespeare. It was his genius that brought it into the
world. He didn't take anybody's property when he created this play
(that's a controversial claim, but never mind), and by his creating
this play, he didn't make it any harder for others to craft a play. So
why is it that the law would ever allow someone else to come along and
take Shakespeare's play without his, or his estate's, permission? What
reason is there to allow someone else to <quote>steal</quote> Shakespeare's work?
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Statute of Anne (1710)</primary></indexterm>
<para>
The answer comes in two parts. We first need to see something special
about the notion of <quote>copyright</quote> that existed at the time of the
Statute of Anne. Second, we have to see something important about
<quote>booksellers.</quote>
</para>
<indexterm><primary>copyright</primary><secondary>usage restrictions attached to</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
First, about copyright. In the last three hundred years, we have come
to apply the concept of <quote>copyright</quote> ever more broadly. But in 1710, it
wasn't so much a concept as it was a very particular right. The
copyright was born as a very specific set of restrictions: It forbade
others from reprinting a book. In 1710, the <quote>copy-right</quote> was a right
to use a particular machine to replicate a particular work. It did not
go beyond that very narrow right. It did not control any more
generally how
<!-- PAGE BREAK 99 -->
a work could be <emphasis>used</emphasis>. Today the right includes a
large collection of restrictions on the freedom of others: It grants
the author the exclusive right to copy, the exclusive right to
distribute, the exclusive right to perform, and so on.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Branagh, Kenneth</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Shakespeare, William</primary></indexterm>
<para>
So, for example, even if the copyright to Shakespeare's works were
perpetual, all that would have meant under the original meaning of the
term was that no one could reprint Shakespeare's work without the
permission of the Shakespeare estate. It would not have controlled
anything, for example, about how the work could be performed, whether
the work could be translated, or whether Kenneth Branagh would be
allowed to make his films. The <quote>copy-right</quote> was only an exclusive
right to print&mdash;no less, of course, but also no more.

<indexterm id='idxmonopolycopyrightas' class='startofrange'><primary>monopoly, copyright as</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Statute of Monopolies (1656)</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Even that limited right was viewed with skepticism by the British.
They had had a long and ugly experience with <quote>exclusive rights,</quote>
especially <quote>exclusive rights</quote> granted by the Crown. The English had
fought a civil war in part about the Crown's practice of handing out
monopolies&mdash;especially monopolies for works that already
existed. King Henry VIII granted a patent to print the Bible and a
monopoly to Darcy to print playing cards. The English Parliament began
to fight back against this power of the Crown. In 1656, it passed the
Statute of Monopolies, limiting monopolies to patents for new
inventions. And by 1710, Parliament was eager to deal with the growing
monopoly in publishing.
</para>
<para>
Thus the <quote>copy-right,</quote> when viewed as a monopoly right, was naturally
viewed as a right that should be limited. (However convincing the
claim that <quote>it's my property, and I should have it forever,</quote> try
sounding convincing when uttering, <quote>It's my monopoly, and I should
have it forever.</quote>) The state would protect the exclusive right, but
only so long as it benefited society. The British saw the harms from
specialinterest favors; they passed a law to stop them.

Second, about booksellers. It wasn't just that the copyright was a
monopoly. It was also that it was a monopoly held by the booksellers.
Booksellers sound quaint and harmless to us. They were not viewed
as harmless in seventeenth-century England. Members of the Conger
<!-- PAGE BREAK 100 -->

were increasingly seen as monopolists of the worst
kind&mdash;tools of the Crown's repression, selling the liberty of
England to guarantee themselves a monopoly profit. The attacks against
these monopolists were harsh: Milton described them as <quote>old patentees

<para>
To balance this power, Parliament decided to increase competition
among booksellers, and the simplest way to do that was to spread the
wealth of valuable books. Parliament therefore limited the term of
copyrights, and thereby guaranteed that valuable books would become
open to any publisher to publish after a limited time. Thus the setting
of the term for existing works to just twenty-one years was a 
		compromise
to fight the power of the booksellers. The limitation on terms was
an indirect way to assure competition among publishers, and thus the
construction and spread of culture.

When 1731 (1710 + 21) came along, however, the booksellers were
getting anxious. They saw the consequences of more competition, and
like every competitor, they didn't like them. At first booksellers simply
ignored the Statute of Anne, continuing to insist on the perpetual right
to control publication. But in 1735 and 1737, they tried to persuade
Parliament to extend their terms. Twenty-one years was not enough,
they said; they needed more time.

Having failed in Parliament, the publishers turned to the courts in a
series of cases. Their argument was simple and direct: The Statute of
Anne gave authors certain protections through positive law, but those
protections were not intended as replacements for the common law.
Instead, they were intended simply to supplement the common law.
Under common law, it was already wrong to take another person's
creative <quote>property</quote> and use it without his permission. The Statute of
Anne, the booksellers argued, didn't change that. Therefore, just
because the protections of the Statute of Anne expired, that didn't
mean the protections of the common law expired: Under the common law
they had the right to ban the publication of a book, even if its
Statute of Anne copyright had expired. This, they argued, was the only
way to protect authors.

Astonishingly to modern lawyers, one of the greatest judges in English
history, Lord Mansfield, agreed with the booksellers. Whatever
protection the Statute of Anne gave booksellers, it did not, he held,
extinguish any common law right. The question was whether the common
law would protect the author against subsequent <quote>pirates.</quote>
Mansfield's answer was yes: The common law would bar Taylor from
reprinting Thomson's poem without Millar's permission. That common law
rule thus effectively gave the booksellers a perpetual right to
control the publication of any book assigned to them.

what it ignored was the larger issue that Parliament had struggled

the monopoly power of publishers? Parliament's strategy was to offer a
term for existing works that was long enough to buy peace in 1710, but
short enough to assure that culture would pass into competition within
a reasonable period of time. Within twenty-one years, Parliament
believed, Britain would mature from the controlled culture that the
Crown coveted to the free culture that we inherited.

As few legal cases ever do, <citetitle>Donaldson</citetitle> v. <citetitle>Beckett</citetitle> drew an
enormous amount of attention throughout Britain. Donaldson's lawyers
argued that whatever rights may have existed under the common law, the
Statute of Anne terminated those rights. After passage of the Statute
of Anne, the only legal protection for an exclusive right to control
publication came from that statute. Thus, they argued, after the term
specified in the Statute of Anne expired, works that had been
protected by the statute were no longer protected.

<quote>Ruined</quote> is a bit of an exaggeration. But it is not an exaggeration to

be respected, for of course, for a limited time after a work was

culture and its growth would no longer be controlled by a small group

culture would grow as the consumers and producers chose. English
culture would develop as the many English readers chose to let it
develop&mdash; chose in the books they bought and wrote; chose in the

Else didn't have the money to buy the right to replay what was playing

</para>
<para>
There's no doubt that someone, whether Matt Groening or Fox, owns the
copyright to <citetitle>The Simpsons</citetitle>. That copyright is their property.  To use
that copyrighted material thus sometimes requires the permission of
the copyright owner. If the use that Else wanted to make of the
<citetitle>Simpsons</citetitle> copyright were one of the uses restricted by the law, then he
would need to get the permission of the copyright owner before he
could use the work in that way. And in a free market, it is the owner
of the copyright who gets to set the price for any use that the law
says the owner gets to control.
</para>
<para>
For example, <quote>public performance</quote> is a use of <citetitle>The Simpsons</citetitle> that the
copyright owner gets to control. If you take a selection of favorite
episodes, rent a movie theater, and charge for tickets to come see <quote>My
Favorite <citetitle>Simpsons</citetitle>,</quote> then you need to get permission from the copyright
owner. And the copyright owner (rightly, in my view) can charge
whatever she wants&mdash;$10 or $1,000,000. That's her right, as set
by the law.
</para>
<para>
But when lawyers hear this story about Jon Else and Fox, their first
thought is <quote>fair use.</quote><footnote><para>

For an excellent argument that such use is <quote>fair use,</quote> but that

Wake of <citetitle>Eldred</citetitle></quote> (draft on file with author), University of Chicago
Law School, 5 August 2003.
</para></footnote>
Else's use of just 4.5 seconds of an indirect shot of a <citetitle>Simpsons</citetitle>
episode is clearly a fair use of <citetitle>The Simpsons</citetitle>&mdash;and fair use does
not require the permission of anyone.

In theory, fair use means you need no permission. The theory therefore
supports free culture and insulates against a permission culture.  But
in practice, fair use functions very differently. The fuzzy lines of
the law, tied to the extraordinary liability if lines are crossed,
means that the effective fair use for many types of creators is
slight. The law has the right aim; practice has defeated the aim.
</para>
<para>
This practice shows just how far the law has come from its
eighteenth-century roots. The law was born as a shield to protect
publishers' profits against the unfair competition of a pirate. It has
matured into a sword that interferes with any use, transformative or
not.

<para>
<emphasis role='strong'>In 1993</emphasis>, Alex Alben was a lawyer
working at Starwave, Inc.  Starwave was an innovative company founded
by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen to develop digital
entertainment. Long before the Internet became popular, Starwave began
investing in new technology for delivering entertainment in
anticipation of the power of networks.

<para>
Alben had a special interest in new technology. He was intrigued by
the emerging market for CD-ROM technology&mdash;not to distribute
film, but to do things with film that otherwise would be very
difficult.  In 1993, he launched an initiative to develop a product to
build retrospectives on the work of particular actors. The first actor
chosen was Clint Eastwood. The idea was to showcase all of the work of
Eastwood, with clips from his films and interviews with figures
important to his career.
</para>
<para>
At that time, Eastwood had made more than fifty films, as an actor and
as a director. Alben began with a series of interviews with Eastwood,
asking him about his career. Because Starwave produced those
interviews, it was free to include them on the CD.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 112 -->
That alone would not have made a very interesting product, so
Starwave wanted to add content from the movies in Eastwood's career:
posters, scripts, and other material relating to the films Eastwood
made. Most of his career was spent at Warner Brothers, and so it was
relatively easy to get permission for that content.
</para>
<para>
Then Alben and his team decided to include actual film clips. <quote>Our
goal was that we were going to have a clip from every one of
Eastwood's films,</quote> Alben told me. It was here that the problem
arose. <quote>No one had ever really done this before,</quote> Alben explained. <quote>No
one had ever tried to do this in the context of an artistic look at an
actor's career.</quote>
</para>
<para>
Alben brought the idea to Michael Slade, the CEO of Starwave.
Slade asked, <quote>Well, what will it take?</quote>
</para>
<para>
Alben replied, <quote>Well, we're going to have to clear rights from
everyone who appears in these films, and the music and everything
else that we want to use in these film clips.</quote> Slade said, <quote>Great! Go
for it.</quote><footnote>
<para>
<!-- f1 -->
Technically, the rights that Alben had to clear were mainly those of
publicity&mdash;rights an artist has to control the commercial
exploitation of his image.  But these rights, too, burden <quote>Rip, Mix,
Burn</quote> creativity, as this chapter evinces.
<indexterm><primary>artists</primary><secondary>publicity rights on images of</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Alben, Alex</primary></indexterm>
</para></footnote>
</para>
<para>
The problem was that neither Alben nor Slade had any idea what
clearing those rights would mean. Every actor in each of the films
could have a claim to royalties for the reuse of that film. But CD-
ROMs had not been specified in the contracts for the actors, so there
was no clear way to know just what Starwave was to do.
</para>
<para>
I asked Alben how he dealt with the problem. With an obvious
pride in his resourcefulness that obscured the obvious bizarreness of his
tale, Alben recounted just what they did:
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
So we very mechanically went about looking up the film clips.  We made
some artistic decisions about what film clips to include&mdash;of
course we were going to use the <quote>Make my day</quote> clip from <citetitle>Dirty
Harry</citetitle>. But you then need to get the guy on the ground who's wiggling
under the gun and you need to get his permission.  And then you have
to decide what you are going to pay him.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 113 -->
We decided that it would be fair if we offered them the dayplayer rate
for the right to reuse that performance. We're talking about a clip of
less than a minute, but to reuse that performance in the CD-ROM the
rate at the time was about $600.  So we had to identify the
people&mdash;some of them were hard to identify because in Eastwood
movies you can't tell who's the guy crashing through the
glass&mdash;is it the actor or is it the stuntman?  And then we just,
we put together a team, my assistant and some others, and we just
started calling people.
</para>
</blockquote>
<indexterm><primary>Sutherland, Donald</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Some actors were glad to help&mdash;Donald Sutherland, for example,
followed up himself to be sure that the rights had been cleared.
Others were dumbfounded at their good fortune. Alben would ask,
<quote>Hey, can I pay you $600 or maybe if you were in two films, you
know, $1,200?</quote> And they would say, <quote>Are you for real? Hey, I'd love
to get $1,200.</quote> And some of course were a bit difficult (estranged
ex-wives, in particular). But eventually, Alben and his team had
cleared the rights to this retrospective CD-ROM on Clint Eastwood's
career.
</para>
<para>
It was one <emphasis>year</emphasis> later&mdash;<quote>and even then we
weren't sure whether we were totally in the clear.</quote>
</para>
<para>
Alben is proud of his work. The project was the first of its kind and
the only time he knew of that a team had undertaken such a massive
project for the purpose of releasing a retrospective.
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
Everyone thought it would be too hard. Everyone just threw up their
hands and said, <quote>Oh, my gosh, a film, it's so many copyrights, there's
the music, there's the screenplay, there's the director, there's the
actors.</quote> But we just broke it down. We just put it into its
constituent parts and said, <quote>Okay, there's this many actors, this many
directors, &hellip; this many musicians,</quote> and we just went at it very
systematically and cleared the rights.
</para>
</blockquote>
<para>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 114 -->
And no doubt, the product itself was exceptionally good. Eastwood
loved it, and it sold very well.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Drucker, Peter</primary></indexterm>
<para>
But I pressed Alben about how weird it seems that it would have to
take a year's work simply to clear rights. No doubt Alben had done
this efficiently, but as Peter Drucker has famously quipped, <quote>There is
nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done
at all.</quote><footnote><para>

Did it make sense, I asked Alben, that this is the way a new work
has to be made?
</para>
<para>
For, as he acknowledged, <quote>very few &hellip; have the time and resources,
and the will to do this,</quote> and thus, very few such works would ever be
made. Does it make sense, I asked him, from the standpoint of what
anybody really thought they were ever giving rights for originally, that
you would have to go clear rights for these kinds of clips?
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
I don't think so. When an actor renders a performance in a movie,
he or she gets paid very well. &hellip; And then when 30 seconds of
that performance is used in a new product that is a retrospective
of somebody's career, I don't think that that person &hellip; should be
compensated for that.
</para>
</blockquote>
<para>
Or at least, is this <emphasis>how</emphasis> the artist should be
compensated? Would it make sense, I asked, for there to be some kind
of statutory license that someone could pay and be free to make
derivative use of clips like this?  Did it really make sense that a
follow-on creator would have to track down every artist, actor,
director, musician, and get explicit permission from each? Wouldn't a
lot more be created if the legal part of the creative process could be
made to be more clean?
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
Absolutely. I think that if there were some fair-licensing
mechanism&mdash;where you weren't subject to hold-ups and you weren't
subject to estranged former spouses&mdash;you'd see a lot more of this
work, because it wouldn't be so daunting to try to put together a
<!-- PAGE BREAK 115 -->
retrospective of someone's career and meaningfully illustrate it with
lots of media from that person's career. You'd build in a cost as the
producer of one of these things. You'd build in a cost of paying X
dollars to the talent that performed. But it would be a known
cost. That's the thing that trips everybody up and makes this kind of
product hard to get off the ground. If you knew I have a hundred
minutes of film in this product and it's going to cost me X, then you
build your budget around it, and you can get investments and
everything else that you need to produce it. But if you say, <quote>Oh, I
want a hundred minutes of something and I have no idea what it's going
to cost me, and a certain number of people are going to hold me up for
money,</quote> then it becomes difficult to put one of these things together.
</para>

<para>
Alben worked for a big company. His company was backed by some of the
richest investors in the world. He therefore had authority and access
that the average Web designer would not have. So if it took him a
year, how long would it take someone else? And how much creativity is
never made just because the costs of clearing the rights are so high?
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxcdroms' class='endofrange'/>
<indexterm startref='idxartistsretrospective' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
These costs are the burdens of a kind of regulation. Put on a
Republican hat for a moment, and get angry for a bit. The government
defines the scope of these rights, and the scope defined determines
how much it's going to cost to negotiate them. (Remember the idea that
land runs to the heavens, and imagine the pilot purchasing flythrough
rights as he negotiates to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco.)
These rights might well have once made sense; but as circumstances
change, they make no sense at all. Or at least, a well-trained,
regulationminimizing Republican should look at the rights and ask,
<quote>Does this still make sense?</quote>

I've seen the flash of recognition when people get this point, but only
a few times. The first was at a conference of federal judges in California.
The judges were gathered to discuss the emerging topic of cyber-law. I
was asked to be on the panel. Harvey Saferstein, a well-respected lawyer

<!-- PAGE BREAK 116 -->
from an L.A. firm, introduced the panel with a video that he and a
friend, Robert Fairbank, had produced.
</para>
<para>
The video was a brilliant collage of film from every period in the
twentieth century, all framed around the idea of a <citetitle>60 Minutes</citetitle> episode.
The execution was perfect, down to the sixty-minute stopwatch. The
judges loved every minute of it.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Nimmer, David</primary></indexterm>
<para>
When the lights came up, I looked over to my copanelist, David
Nimmer, perhaps the leading copyright scholar and practitioner in the
nation. He had an astonished look on his face, as he peered across the
room of over 250 well-entertained judges. Taking an ominous tone, he
began his talk with a question: <quote>Do you know how many federal laws
were just violated in this room?</quote>
</para>
<para>

<indexterm><primary>Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Napster</primary></indexterm>
For of course, the two brilliantly talented creators who made this
film hadn't done what Alben did. They hadn't spent a year clearing the
rights to these clips; technically, what they had done violated the
law.  Of course, it wasn't as if they or anyone were going to be
prosecuted for this violation (the presence of 250 judges and a gaggle
of federal marshals notwithstanding). But Nimmer was making an
important point: A year before anyone would have heard of the word
Napster, and two years before another member of our panel, David
Boies, would defend Napster before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
Nimmer was trying to get the judges to see that the law would not be
friendly to the capacities that this technology would
enable. Technology means you can now do amazing things easily; but you
couldn't easily do them legally.

<para>
We live in a <quote>cut and paste</quote> culture enabled by technology. Anyone
building a presentation knows the extraordinary freedom that the cut

find just about any image you want; in another second, you can have it
planted in your presentation.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Camp Chaos</primary></indexterm>
<para>
But presentations are just a tiny beginning. Using the Internet and
<!-- PAGE BREAK 117 -->
its archives, musicians are able to string together mixes of sound
never before imagined; filmmakers are able to build movies out of
clips on computers around the world. An extraordinary site in Sweden
takes images of politicians and blends them with music to create
biting political commentary. A site called Camp Chaos has produced
some of the most biting criticism of the record industry that there is
through the mixing of Flash! and music.
</para>
<para>
All of these creations are technically illegal. Even if the creators
wanted to be <quote>legal,</quote> the cost of complying with the law is impossibly
high. Therefore, for the law-abiding sorts, a wealth of creativity is
never made. And for that part that is made, if it doesn't follow the
clearance rules, it doesn't get released.
</para>
<para>
To some, these stories suggest a solution: Let's alter the mix of
rights so that people are free to build upon our culture. Free to add
or mix as they see fit. We could even make this change without
necessarily requiring that the <quote>free</quote> use be free as in <quote>free beer.</quote>
Instead, the system could simply make it easy for follow-on creators
to compensate artists without requiring an army of lawyers to come
along: a rule, for example, that says <quote>the royalty owed the copyright
owner of an unregistered work for the derivative reuse of his work
will be a flat 1 percent of net revenues, to be held in escrow for the
copyright owner.</quote> Under this rule, the copyright owner could benefit
from some royalty, but he would not have the benefit of a full
property right (meaning the right to name his own price) unless he
registers the work.
</para>
<para>
Who could possibly object to this? And what reason would there be
for objecting? We're talking about work that is not now being made;
which if made, under this plan, would produce new income for artists.
What reason would anyone have to oppose it?

<emphasis role='strong'>In February 2003</emphasis>, DreamWorks
studios announced an agreement with Mike Myers, the comic genius of
<citetitle>Saturday Night Live</citetitle> and
<!-- PAGE BREAK 118 -->
Austin Powers. According to the announcement, Myers and Dream-Works
would work together to form a <quote>unique filmmaking pact.</quote> Under the
agreement, DreamWorks <quote>will acquire the rights to existing motion
picture hits and classics, write new storylines and&mdash;with the use
of stateof-the-art digital technology&mdash;insert Myers and other
actors into the film, thereby creating an entirely new piece of
entertainment.</quote>
</para>
<para>
The announcement called this <quote>film sampling.</quote> As Myers explained,
<quote>Film Sampling is an exciting way to put an original spin on existing
films and allow audiences to see old movies in a new light. Rap
artists have been doing this for years with music and now we are able
to take that same concept and apply it to film.</quote> Steven Spielberg is
quoted as saying, <quote>If anyone can create a way to bring old films to
new audiences, it is Mike.</quote>
</para>
<para>
Spielberg is right. Film sampling by Myers will be brilliant. But if
you don't think about it, you might miss the truly astonishing point
about this announcement. As the vast majority of our film heritage
remains under copyright, the real meaning of the DreamWorks
announcement is just this: It is Mike Myers and only Mike Myers who is
free to sample. Any general freedom to build upon the film archive of
our culture, a freedom in other contexts presumed for us all, is now a
privilege reserved for the funny and famous&mdash;and presumably rich.
</para>
<para>
This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons. The first
continues the story of the last chapter: the vagueness of <quote>fair use.</quote>
Much of <quote>sampling</quote> should be considered <quote>fair use.</quote> But few would
rely upon so weak a doctrine to create. That leads to the second reason
that the privilege is reserved for the few: The costs of negotiating the
legal rights for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high.
These costs mirror the costs with fair use: You either pay a lawyer to
defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions
so you don't have to rely upon fair use rights. Either way, the creative
process is a process of paying lawyers&mdash;again a privilege, or perhaps a
curse, reserved for the few.

you could go to your public library and look at the newspapers. Those

<para>
It is said that those who fail to remember history are doomed to

objective past can keep us honest. Libraries help do that, by
collecting content and keeping it, for schoolchildren, for
researchers, for grandma. A free society presumes this knowedge.

The Internet was an exception to this presumption. Until the Internet

quintessentially transitory medium. And yet, as it becomes more

In part, this is because of the law. Early in American copyright law,
copyright owners were required to deposit copies of their work in
libraries.  These copies were intended both to facilitate the spread

The same is generally true about television. Television broadcasts

Kahle established the Movie Archive. Prelinger let Kahle digitize

copies of these films as stock footage. What he has discovered is that

footage sales went up dramatically. People could easily find the

films on their own. Others purchased copies to enable other films to
be made.  Either way, the archive enabled access to this important
part of our culture.  Want to see a copy of the <quote>Duck and Cover</quote> film
that instructed children how to save themselves in the middle of
nuclear attack? Go to archive.org, and you can download the film in a
few minutes&mdash;for free.
</para>
<para>
Here again, Kahle is providing access to a part of our culture that we
otherwise could not get easily, if at all. It is yet another part of
what defines the twentieth century that we have lost to history. The
law doesn't require these copies to be kept by anyone, or to be
deposited in an archive by anyone. Therefore, there is no simple way
to find them.
</para>
<para>
The key here is access, not price. Kahle wants to enable free access
to this content, but he also wants to enable others to sell access to
it. His aim is to ensure competition in access to this important part
of our culture.  Not during the commercial life of a bit of creative
property, but during a second life that all creative property
has&mdash;a noncommercial life.
</para>
<para>
For here is an idea that we should more clearly recognize. Every bit
of creative property goes through different <quote>lives.</quote> In its first
life, if the

<!-- PAGE BREAK 124 -->
creator is lucky, the content is sold. In such cases the commercial
market is successful for the creator. The vast majority of creative
property doesn't enjoy such success, but some clearly does. For that
content, commercial life is extremely important. Without this
commercial market, there would be, many argue, much less creativity.
</para>
<para>
After the commercial life of creative property has ended, our
tradition has always supported a second life as well. A newspaper
delivers the news every day to the doorsteps of America. The very next
day, it is used to wrap fish or to fill boxes with fragile gifts or to
build an archive of knowledge about our history. In this second life,
the content can continue to inform even if that information is no
longer sold.

get to read the book, also for free. Used book stores and libraries
are thus the second life of a book. That second life is extremely
important to the spread and stability of culture.
</para>
<para>
Yet increasingly, any assumption about a stable second life for
creative property does not hold true with the most important
components of popular culture in the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries. For these&mdash;television, movies, music, radio, the
Internet&mdash;there is no guarantee of a second life. For these sorts
of culture, it is as if we've replaced libraries with Barnes &amp;
Noble superstores. With this culture, what's accessible is nothing but
what a certain limited market demands.  Beyond that, culture
disappears.

<emphasis role='strong'>For most of</emphasis> the twentieth century,
it was economics that made this so. It would have been insanely
expensive to collect and make accessible all television and film and
music: The cost of analog copies is extraordinarily high. So even
though the law in principle would have restricted the ability of a
Brewster Kahle to copy culture generally, the
<!-- PAGE BREAK 125 -->
real restriction was economics. The market made it impossibly
difficult to do anything about this ephemeral culture; the law had
little practical effect.

Perhaps the single most important feature of the digital revolution is
that for the first time since the Library of Alexandria, it is

possible to imagine an archive of all moving images and sound.

<emphasis role='strong'>Jack Valenti</emphasis> has been the president

to Washington, D.C., with Lyndon Johnson's
administration&mdash;literally. The famous picture of Johnson's

running the MPAA, Valenti has established himself as perhaps the most

<para>
The MPAA is the American branch of the international Motion Picture
Association. It was formed in 1922 as a trade association whose goal
was to defend American movies against increasing domestic criticism.
The organization now represents not only filmmakers but producers and
distributors of entertainment for television, video, and cable. Its
board is made up of the chairmen and presidents of the seven major
producers and distributors of motion picture and television programs
in the United States: Walt Disney, Sony Pictures Entertainment, MGM,
Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal Studios, and
Warner Brothers.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 128 -->
Valenti is only the third president of the MPAA. No president before
him has had as much influence over that organization, or over
Washington. As a Texan, Valenti has mastered the single most important
political skill of a Southerner&mdash;the ability to appear simple and
slow while hiding a lightning-fast intellect. To this day, Valenti
plays the simple, humble man. But this Harvard MBA, and author of four
books, who finished high school at the age of fifteen and flew more
than fifty combat missions in World War II, is no Mr. Smith. When
Valenti went to Washington, he mastered the city in a quintessentially
Washingtonian way.
</para>
<para>
In defending artistic liberty and the freedom of speech that our
culture depends upon, the MPAA has done important good. In crafting
the MPAA rating system, it has probably avoided a great deal of
speech-regulating harm. But there is an aspect to the organization's
mission that is both the most radical and the most important. This is
the organization's effort, epitomized in Valenti's every act, to
redefine the meaning of <quote>creative property.</quote>
</para>
<para>
In 1982, Valenti's testimony to Congress captured the strategy
perfectly:
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
No matter the lengthy arguments made, no matter the charges and the
counter-charges, no matter the tumult and the shouting, reasonable men
and women will keep returning to the fundamental issue, the central
theme which animates this entire debate: <emphasis>Creative property
owners must be accorded the same rights and protection resident in all
other property owners in the nation</emphasis>. That is the issue.
That is the question. And that is the rostrum on which this entire
hearing and the debates to follow must rest.<footnote><para>

Representatives, 97th Cong., 2nd sess. (1982): 65 (testimony of Jack
Valenti).

</para>
</blockquote>
<para>
The strategy of this rhetoric, like the strategy of most of Valenti's
rhetoric, is brilliant and simple and brilliant because simple. The
<quote>central theme</quote> to which <quote>reasonable men and women</quote> will return is
this:
<!-- PAGE BREAK 129 -->
<quote>Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and
protections resident in all other property owners in the nation.</quote>
There are no second-class citizens, Valenti might have
continued. There should be no second-class property owners.
</para>
<para>
This claim has an obvious and powerful intuitive pull. It is stated
with such clarity as to make the idea as obvious as the notion that we
use elections to pick presidents. But in fact, there is no more
extreme a claim made by <emphasis>anyone</emphasis> who is serious in
this debate than this claim of Valenti's. Jack Valenti, however sweet
and however brilliant, is perhaps the nation's foremost extremist when
it comes to the nature and scope of <quote>creative property.</quote> His views
have <emphasis>no</emphasis> reasonable connection to our actual legal
tradition, even if the subtle pull of his Texan charm has slowly
redefined that tradition, at least in Washington.

While <quote>creative property</quote> is certainly <quote>property</quote> in a nerdy and
precise sense that lawyers are trained to understand,<footnote><para>

Lawyers speak of <quote>property</quote> not as an absolute thing, but as a bundle

Constitution</citetitle> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977), 26&ndash;27.
</para></footnote> it has never been the case, nor should it be, that
<quote>creative property owners</quote> have been <quote>accorded the same rights and
protection resident in all other property owners.</quote> Indeed, if creative
property owners were given the same rights as all other property
owners, that would effect a radical, and radically undesirable, change
in our tradition.
</para>
<para>
Valenti knows this. But he speaks for an industry that cares squat for
our tradition and the values it represents. He speaks for an industry
that is instead fighting to restore the tradition that the British
overturned in 1710. In the world that Valenti's changes would create,
a powerful few would exercise powerful control over how our creative
culture would develop.
</para>
<para>
I have two purposes in this chapter. The first is to convince you
that, historically, Valenti's claim is absolutely wrong. The second is
to convince you that it would be terribly wrong for us to reject our
history.  We have always treated rights in creative property
differently from the rights resident in all other property
owners. They have never been the same. And they should never be the
same, because, however counterintuitive this may seem, to make them
the same would be to

<!-- PAGE BREAK 130 -->
fundamentally weaken the opportunity for new creators to create.
Creativity depends upon the owners of creativity having less than
perfect control.
</para>
<para>
Organizations such as the MPAA, whose board includes the most powerful
of the old guard, have little interest, their rhetoric
notwithstanding, in assuring that the new can displace them. No
organization does. No person does. (Ask me about tenure, for example.)
But what's good for the MPAA is not necessarily good for America. A
society that defends the ideals of free culture must preserve
precisely the opportunity for new creativity to threaten the old.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role='strong'>To get</emphasis> just a hint that there is
something fundamentally wrong in Valenti's argument, we need look no
further than the United States Constitution itself.
</para>
<para>
The framers of our Constitution loved <quote>property.</quote> Indeed, so strongly
did they love property that they built into the Constitution an
important requirement. If the government takes your property&mdash;if
it condemns your house, or acquires a slice of land from your
farm&mdash;it is required, under the Fifth Amendment's <quote>Takings
Clause,</quote> to pay you <quote>just compensation</quote> for that taking. The
Constitution thus guarantees that property is, in a certain sense,
sacred. It cannot <emphasis>ever</emphasis> be taken from the property
owner unless the government pays for the privilege.
</para>
<para>
Yet the very same Constitution speaks very differently about what
Valenti calls <quote>creative property.</quote> In the clause granting Congress the
power to create <quote>creative property,</quote> the Constitution
<emphasis>requires</emphasis> that after a <quote>limited time,</quote> Congress
take back the rights that it has granted and set the <quote>creative
property</quote> free to the public domain. Yet when Congress does this, when
the expiration of a copyright term <quote>takes</quote> your copyright and turns it
over to the public domain, Congress does not have any obligation to
pay <quote>just compensation</quote> for this <quote>taking.</quote>  Instead, the same
Constitution that requires compensation for your land
<!-- PAGE BREAK 131 -->
requires that you lose your <quote>creative property</quote> right without any
compensation at all.
</para>
<para>
The Constitution thus on its face states that these two forms of
property are not to be accorded the same rights. They are plainly to
be treated differently. Valenti is therefore not just asking for a
change in our tradition when he argues that creative-property owners
should be accorded the same rights as every other property-right
owner. He is effectively arguing for a change in our Constitution
itself.
</para>
<indexterm id='idxjeffersonthomas' class='startofrange'><primary>Jefferson, Thomas</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Arguing for a change in our Constitution is not necessarily wrong.
There was much in our original Constitution that was plainly wrong.
The Constitution of 1789 entrenched slavery; it left senators to be
appointed rather than elected; it made it possible for the electoral
college to produce a tie between the president and his own vice
president (as it did in 1800). The framers were no doubt
extraordinary, but I would be the first to admit that they made big
mistakes. We have since rejected some of those mistakes; no doubt
there could be others that we should reject as well. So my argument is
not simply that because Jefferson did it, we should, too.
</para>
<para>
Instead, my argument is that because Jefferson did it, we should at
least try to understand <emphasis>why</emphasis>. Why did the framers,
fanatical property types that they were, reject the claim that
creative property be given the same rights as all other property? Why
did they require that for creative property there must be a public
domain?
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxjeffersonthomas' class='endofrange'/>

<para>
To answer this question, we need to get some perspective on the
history of these <quote>creative property</quote> rights, and the control that they
enabled.  Once we see clearly how differently these rights have been
defined, we will be in a better position to ask the question that
should be at the core of this war: Not <emphasis>whether</emphasis>
creative property should be protected, but how. Not
<emphasis>whether</emphasis> we will enforce the rights the law gives
to creative-property owners, but what the particular mix of rights
ought to be. Not <emphasis>whether</emphasis> artists should be paid,
but whether institutions designed to assure that artists get paid need
also control how culture develops.

<!-- PAGE BREAK 132 -->
To answer these questions, we need a more general way to talk about
how property is protected. More precisely, we need a more general way
than the narrow language of the law allows. In <citetitle>Code and Other Laws of
Cyberspace</citetitle>, I used a simple model to capture this more general
perspective. For any particular right or regulation, this model asks
how four different modalities of regulation interact to support or
weaken the right or regulation. I represented it with this diagram:
</para>
<figure id="fig-1331">
<title></title>
<graphic fileref="images/1331.svg" align="center" width="10em"></graphic>
</figure>
<indexterm><primary>Madonna</primary></indexterm>
<para>
At the center of this picture is a regulated dot: the individual or
group that is the target of regulation, or the holder of a right. (In
each case throughout, we can describe this either as regulation or as
a right.  For simplicity's sake, I will speak only of regulations.)
The ovals represent four ways in which the individual or group might
be regulated&mdash; either constrained or, alternatively, enabled. Law
is the most obvious constraint (to lawyers, at least). It constrains
by threatening punishments after the fact if the rules set in advance
are violated. So if, for example, you willfully infringe Madonna's
copyright by copying a song from her latest CD and posting it on the
Web, you can be punished
<!-- PAGE BREAK 133 -->
with a $150,000 fine. The fine is an ex post punishment for violating
an ex ante rule. It is imposed by the state.
<indexterm><primary>Madonna</primary></indexterm>
</para>
<indexterm><primary>norms, regulatory influence of</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Norms are a different kind of constraint. They, too, punish an
individual for violating a rule. But the punishment of a norm is
imposed by a community, not (or not only) by the state. There may be
no law against spitting, but that doesn't mean you won't be punished
if you spit on the ground while standing in line at a movie. The
punishment might not be harsh, though depending upon the community, it
could easily be more harsh than many of the punishments imposed by the
state. The mark of the difference is not the severity of the rule, but
the source of the enforcement.
</para>
<indexterm id='idxmarketconstraints' class='startofrange'><primary>market constraints</primary></indexterm>
<para>
The market is a third type of constraint. Its constraint is effected
through conditions: You can do X if you pay Y; you'll be paid M if you
do N. These constraints are obviously not independent of law or
norms&mdash;it is property law that defines what must be bought if it
is to be taken legally; it is norms that say what is appropriately
sold. But given a set of norms, and a background of property and
contract law, the market imposes a simultaneous constraint upon how an
individual or group might behave.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>architecture, constraint effected through</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Finally, and for the moment, perhaps, most mysteriously,
<quote>architecture</quote>&mdash;the physical world as one finds it&mdash;is a
constraint on behavior.  A fallen bridge might constrain your ability
to get across a river. Railroad tracks might constrain the ability of
a community to integrate its social life. As with the market,
architecture does not effect its constraint through ex post
punishments. Instead, also as with the market, architecture effects
its constraint through simultaneous conditions. These conditions are
imposed not by courts enforcing contracts, or by police punishing
theft, but by nature, by <quote>architecture.</quote>  If a 500-pound boulder
blocks your way, it is the law of gravity that enforces this
constraint. If a $500 airplane ticket stands between you and a flight
to New York, it is the market that enforces this constraint.

<!-- PAGE BREAK 134 -->
So the first point about these four modalities of regulation is
obvious: They interact. Restrictions imposed by one might be
reinforced by another. Or restrictions imposed by one might be
undermined by another.
</para>
<para>
The second point follows directly: If we want to understand the
effective freedom that anyone has at a given moment to do any
particular thing, we have to consider how these four modalities
interact.  Whether or not there are other constraints (there may well
be; my claim is not about comprehensiveness), these four are among the
most significant, and any regulator (whether controlling or freeing)
must consider how these four in particular interact.

<indexterm id='idxspeedingconstraintson' class='startofrange'><primary>speeding, constraints on</primary></indexterm>
<para>
So, for example, consider the <quote>freedom</quote> to drive a car at a high
speed. That freedom is in part restricted by laws: speed limits that
say how fast you can drive in particular places at particular
times. It is in part restricted by architecture: speed bumps, for
example, slow most rational drivers; governors in buses, as another
example, set the maximum rate at which the driver can drive. The
freedom is in part restricted by the market: Fuel efficiency drops as
speed increases, thus the price of gasoline indirectly constrains
speed. And finally, the norms of a community may or may not constrain
the freedom to speed. Drive at 50 mph by a school in your own
neighborhood and you're likely to be punished by the neighbors. The
same norm wouldn't be as effective in a different town, or at night.
</para>
<para>
The final point about this simple model should also be fairly clear:
While these four modalities are analytically independent, law has a
special role in affecting the three.<footnote><para>
<!-- f3 -->
By describing the way law affects the other three modalities, I don't
mean to suggest that the other three don't affect law. Obviously, they
do. Law's only distinction is that it alone speaks as if it has a
right self-consciously to change the other three. The right of the
other three is more timidly expressed.  See Lawrence Lessig, <citetitle>Code: And
Other Laws of Cyberspace</citetitle> (New York: Basic Books, 1999): 90&ndash;95;
Lawrence Lessig, <quote>The New Chicago School,</quote> <citetitle>Journal of Legal Studies</citetitle>,
June 1998.
<indexterm><primary>Code (Lessig)</primary></indexterm>
</para></footnote>
The law, in other words, sometimes operates to increase or decrease
the constraint of a particular modality.  Thus, the law might be used
to increase taxes on gasoline, so as to increase the incentives to
drive more slowly. The law might be used to mandate more speed bumps,
so as to increase the difficulty of driving rapidly. The law might be
used to fund ads that stigmatize reckless driving. Or the law might be
used to require that other laws be more
<!-- PAGE BREAK 135 -->
strict&mdash;a federal requirement that states decrease the speed
limit, for example&mdash;so as to decrease the attractiveness of fast
driving.

<para>
These constraints can thus change, and they can be changed. To
understand the effective protection of liberty or protection of
property at any particular moment, we must track these changes over
time. A restriction imposed by one modality might be erased by
another. A freedom enabled by one modality might be displaced by
another.<footnote>
<para>
<!-- f4 -->
Some people object to this way of talking about <quote>liberty.</quote> They object
because their focus when considering the constraints that exist at any
particular moment are constraints imposed exclusively by the
government. For instance, if a storm destroys a bridge, these people
think it is meaningless to say that one's liberty has been
restrained. A bridge has washed out, and it's harder to get from one
place to another. To talk about this as a loss of freedom, they say,
is to confuse the stuff of politics with the vagaries of ordinary
life.  I don't mean to deny the value in this narrower view, which
depends upon the context of the inquiry. I do, however, mean to argue
against any insistence that this narrower view is the only proper view
of liberty. As I argued in <citetitle>Code</citetitle>, we come from a
long tradition of political thought with a broader focus than the
narrow question of what the government did when.  John Stuart Mill
defended freedom of speech, for example, from the tyranny of narrow
minds, not from the fear of government prosecution; John Stuart Mill,
<citetitle>On Liberty</citetitle> (Indiana: Hackett Publishing Co.,
1978), 19.  John R. Commons famously defended the economic freedom of
labor from constraints imposed by the market; John R. Commons, <quote>The
Right to Work,</quote> in Malcom Rutherford and Warren J. Samuels, eds.,
<citetitle>John R. Commons: Selected Essays</citetitle> (London:
Routledge: 1997), 62. The Americans with Disabilities Act increases
the liberty of people with physical disabilities by changing the
architecture of certain public places, thereby making access to those
places easier; 42 <citetitle>United States Code</citetitle>, section
12101 (2000).  Each of these interventions to change existing
conditions changes the liberty of a particular group. The effect of
those interventions should be accounted for in order to understand the
effective liberty that each of these groups might face.

The most obvious point that this model reveals is just why, or just
how, Hollywood is right. The copyright warriors have rallied Congress
and the courts to defend copyright. This model helps us see why that
rallying makes sense.

Let's say this is the picture of copyright's regulation before the

<!-- PAGE BREAK 136 -->
There is balance between law, norms, market, and architecture. The law
limits the ability to copy and share content, by imposing penalties on
those who copy and share content. Those penalties are reinforced by
technologies that make it hard to copy and share content
(architecture) and expensive to copy and share content
(market). Finally, those penalties are mitigated by norms we all
recognize&mdash;kids, for example, taping other kids' records. These
uses of copyrighted material may well be infringement, but the norms
of our society (before the Internet, at least) had no problem with
this form of infringement.

Enter the Internet, or, more precisely, technologies such as MP3s and
p2p sharing. Now the constraint of architecture changes dramatically,
as does the constraint of the market. And as both the market and
architecture relax the regulation of copyright, norms pile on. The
happy balance (for the warriors, at least) of life before the Internet
becomes an effective state of anarchy after the Internet.

Technology has changed, the warriors say, and the effect of this
change, when ramified through the market and norms, is that a balance

Neither this analysis nor the conclusions that follow are new to the
warriors. Indeed, in a <quote>White Paper</quote> prepared by the Commerce
Department (one heavily influenced by the copyright warriors) in 1995,
this mix of regulatory modalities had already been identified and the
strategy to respond already mapped. In response to the changes the
Internet had effected, the White Paper argued (1) Congress should
strengthen intellectual property law, (2) businesses should adopt
innovative marketing techniques, (3) technologists should push to
develop code to protect copyrighted material, and (4) educators should
educate kids to better protect copyright.

This mixed strategy is just what copyright needed&mdash;if it was to
preserve the particular balance that existed before the change induced
by the Internet. And it's just what we should expect the content
industry to push for. It is as American as apple pie to consider the
happy life you have as an entitlement, and to look to the law to
protect it if something comes along to change that happy
life. Homeowners living in a

Thus, there's nothing wrong or surprising in the content industry's

But just because a particular interest asks for government support, it
doesn't follow that support should be granted. And just because
technology has weakened a particular way of doing business, it doesn't
follow that the government should intervene to support that old way of
doing business. Kodak, for example, has lost perhaps as much as 20
percent of their traditional film market to the emerging technologies
of digital cameras.<footnote><para>

Does anyone believe the government should ban digital cameras just to

Closer to the subject of this book, remote channel changers have
weakened the <quote>stickiness</quote> of television advertising (if a boring
commercial comes on the TV, the remote makes it easy to surf), and it
may well be that this change has weakened the television advertising
market. But does anyone believe we should regulate remotes to

only once a second, or to switch to only ten channels within an hour?)

The obvious answer to these obviously rhetorical questions is no.
In a free society, with a free market, supported by free enterprise and

business against others. Its role is not to pick winners and protect
them against loss. If the government did this generally, then we would
never have any progress. As Microsoft chairman Bill Gates wrote in
1991, in a memo criticizing software patents, <quote>established companies
have an interest in excluding future competitors.</quote><footnote><para>

And relative to a
startup, established companies also have the means. (Think RCA and
FM radio.) A world in which competitors with new ideas must fight
not only the market but also the government is a world in which
competitors with new ideas will not succeed. It is a world of stasis and
increasingly concentrated stagnation. It is the Soviet Union under
Brezhnev.
</para>
<para>
Thus, while it is understandable for industries threatened with new
technologies that change the way they do business to look to the
government for protection, it is the special duty of policy makers to
guarantee that that protection not become a deterrent to progress. It
is the duty of policy makers, in other words, to assure that the
changes they create, in response to the request of those hurt by
changing technology, are changes that preserve the incentives and
opportunities for innovation and change.

<para>
In the context of laws regulating speech&mdash;which include,
obviously, copyright law&mdash;that duty is even stronger. When the
industry complaining about changing technologies is asking Congress to
respond in a way that burdens speech and creativity, policy makers
should be especially wary of the request. It is always a bad deal for
the government to get into the business of regulating speech
markets. The risks and dangers of that game are precisely why our
framers created the First Amendment to our Constitution: <quote>Congress
shall make no law &hellip;  abridging the freedom of speech.</quote> So when
Congress is being asked to pass laws that would <quote>abridge</quote> the freedom
of speech, it should ask&mdash; carefully&mdash;whether such
regulation is justified.

In 1873, the chemical DDT was first synthesized. In 1948, Swiss

No one set out to destroy the environment. Paul MÃ¼ller certainly did
not aim to harm any birds. But the effort to solve one set of problems
produced another set which, in the view of some, was far worse than
the problems that were originally attacked. Or more accurately, the
problems DDT caused were worse than the problems it solved, at least
when considering the other, more environmentally friendly ways to
solve the problems that DDT was meant to solve.

His point, and the point I want to develop in the balance of this

protect authors will have unintended consequences for the cultural
environment, much like DDT had for the natural environment. And just
<!-- PAGE BREAK 141 -->
as criticism of DDT is not an endorsement of malaria or an attack on
farmers, so, too, is criticism of one particular set of regulations
protecting copyright not an endorsement of anarchy or an attack on
authors.  It is an environment of creativity that we seek, and we
should be aware of our actions' effects on the environment.

<para>
My argument, in the balance of this chapter, tries to map exactly
this effect. No doubt the technology of the Internet has had a dramatic
effect on the ability of copyright owners to protect their content. But
there should also be little doubt that when you add together the
changes in copyright law over time, plus the change in technology that
the Internet is undergoing just now, the net effect of these changes will
not be only that copyrighted work is effectively protected. Also, and
generally missed, the net effect of this massive increase in protection
will be devastating to the environment for creativity.

The Progress Clause expressly limits the term of copyrights. As we saw
in chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="founders"/>,
the English limited the term of copyright so as to assure that a few
would not exercise disproportionate control over culture by exercising
disproportionate control over publishing. We can assume the framers
followed the English for a similar purpose. Indeed, unlike the
English, the framers reinforced that objective, by requiring that

The design of the Progress Clause reflects something about the

built structure. To prevent the concentrated power of publishers, they
built a structure that kept copyrights away from publishers and kept
them short. To prevent the concentrated power of a church, they banned
the federal government from establishing a church. To prevent
concentrating power in the federal government, they built structures
to reinforce the power of the states&mdash;including the Senate, whose
members were at the time selected by the states, and an electoral
college, also selected by the states, to select the president. In each

When the first Congress enacted laws to protect creative property, it
faced the same uncertainty about the status of creative property that
the English had confronted in 1774. Many states had passed laws
protecting creative property, and some believed that these laws simply
supplemented common law rights that already protected creative
authorship.<footnote>

This meant that there was no guaranteed public domain in the United
States in 1790. If copyrights were protected by the common law, then
there was no simple way to know whether a work published in the United
States was controlled or free. Just as in England, this lingering
uncertainty would make it hard for publishers to rely upon a public
domain to reprint and distribute works.

That uncertainty ended after Congress passed legislation granting
copyrights. Because federal law overrides any contrary state law,
federal protections for copyrighted works displaced any state law
protections.  Just as in England the Statute of Anne eventually meant
that the copyrights for all English works expired, a federal statute
meant that any state copyrights expired as well.

In 1790, Congress enacted the first copyright law. It created a

the author was alive at the end of that fourteen years, then he could
opt to renew the copyright for another fourteen years. If he did not
renew the copyright, his work passed into the public domain.

While there were many works created in the United States in the first
ten years of the Republic, only 5 percent of the works were actually
registered under the federal copyright regime. Of all the work created
in the United States both before 1790 and from 1790 through 1800, 95
percent immediately passed into the public domain; the balance would
pass into the pubic domain within twenty-eight years at most, and more
likely within fourteen years.<footnote><para>

Although 13,000 titles were published in the United States from 1790
to 1799, only 556 copyright registrations were filed; John Tebbel, <citetitle>A
History of Book Publishing in the United States</citetitle>, vol. 1, <citetitle>The Creation
of an Industry, 1630&ndash;1865</citetitle> (New York: Bowker, 1972), 141. Of the 21,000

and the Copyright Law of 1790 in Historical Context</citetitle>, 7&ndash;10 (2002),

immediately into the public domain. Even those works that were
copyrighted fell into the public domain quickly, because the term of
copyright was short. The initial term of copyright was fourteen years,
with the option of renewal for an additional fourteen years. Copyright

This system of renewal was a crucial part of the American system
of copyright. It assured that the maximum terms of copyright would be

granted only for works where they were wanted. After the initial term
of fourteen years, if it wasn't worth it to an author to renew his
copyright, then it wasn't worth it to society to insist on the
copyright, either.

Fourteen years may not seem long to us, but for the vast majority of
copyright owners at that time, it was long enough: Only a small
minority of them renewed their copyright after fourteen years; the
balance allowed their work to pass into the public

Few copyright holders ever chose to renew their copyrights. For

Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that has defined
copyright law since. Eleven times in the last forty years, Congress
has extended the terms of existing copyrights; twice in those forty
years, Congress extended the term of future copyrights. Initially, the
extensions of existing copyrights were short, a mere one to two years.
In 1976, Congress extended all existing copyrights by nineteen years.
And in 1998, in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, Congress
extended the term of existing and future copyrights by twenty years.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>patents</primary><secondary>in public domain</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the passing
of works into the public domain. This latest extension means that the
public domain will have been tolled for thirty-nine out of fifty-five
years, or 70 percent of the time since 1962. Thus, in the twenty years

<!-- PAGE BREAK 146 -->
after the Sonny Bono Act, while one million patents will pass into the
public domain, zero copyrights will pass into the public domain by virtue
of the expiration of a copyright term.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxsonnybonocopyrighttermextensionactctea' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
The effect of these extensions has been exacerbated by another,
little-noticed change in the copyright law. Remember I said that the
framers established a two-part copyright regime, requiring a copyright
owner to renew his copyright after an initial term. The requirement of
renewal meant that works that no longer needed copyright protection
would pass more quickly into the public domain. The works remaining
under protection would be those that had some continuing commercial
value.

<para>
The United States abandoned this sensible system in 1976. For
all works created after 1978, there was only one copyright term&mdash;the
maximum term. For <quote>natural</quote> authors, that term was life plus fifty
years. For corporations, the term was seventy-five years. Then, in 1992,
Congress abandoned the renewal requirement for all works created
before 1978. All works still under copyright would be accorded the
maximum term then available. After the Sonny Bono Act, that term
was ninety-five years.
</para>
<para>
This change meant that American law no longer had an automatic way to
assure that works that were no longer exploited passed into the public
domain. And indeed, after these changes, it is unclear whether it is
even possible to put works into the public domain. The public domain
is orphaned by these changes in copyright law. Despite the requirement
that terms be <quote>limited,</quote> we have no evidence that anything will limit
them.
</para>

<indexterm startref='idxpublicdomainfuturepatentsvsfuturecopyrightsin' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
The effect of these changes on the average duration of copyright is
dramatic. In 1973, more than 85 percent of copyright owners failed to
renew their copyright. That meant that the average term of copyright
in 1973 was just 32.2 years. Because of the elimination of the renewal
requirement, the average term of copyright is now the maximum term.
In thirty years, then, the average term has tripled, from 32.2 years to 95
years.<footnote><para>
<!-- f12 -->
These statistics are understated. Between the years 1910 and 1962 (the
first year the renewal term was extended), the average term was never
more than thirty-two years, and averaged thirty years. See Landes and

The <quote>scope</quote> of a copyright is the range of rights granted by the law.
The scope of American copyright has changed dramatically. Those
changes are not necessarily bad. But we should understand the extent
of the changes if we're to keep this debate in context.

<indexterm id='idxderivativeworkshistoricalshiftincopyrightcoverageof' class='startofrange'><primary>derivative works</primary><secondary>historical shift in copyright coverage of</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
In 1790, that scope was very narrow. Copyright covered only <quote>maps,
charts, and books.</quote> That means it didn't cover, for example, music or
architecture. More significantly, the right granted by a copyright gave
the author the exclusive right to <quote>publish</quote> copyrighted works. That
means someone else violated the copyright only if he republished the
work without the copyright owner's permission. Finally, the right granted
by a copyright was an exclusive right to that particular book. The right
did not extend to what lawyers call <quote>derivative works.</quote> It would not,
therefore, interfere with the right of someone other than the author to
translate a copyrighted book, or to adapt the story to a different form
(such as a drama based on a published book).
</para>
<para>
This, too, has changed dramatically. While the contours of copyright
today are extremely hard to describe simply, in general terms, the
right covers practically any creative work that is reduced to a
tangible form. It covers music as well as architecture, drama as well
as computer programs. It gives the copyright owner of that creative
work not only the exclusive right to <quote>publish</quote> the work, but also the
exclusive right of control over any <quote>copies</quote> of that work. And most
significant for our purposes here, the right gives the copyright owner
control over not only his or her particular work, but also any
<quote>derivative work</quote> that might grow out of the original work. In this
way, the right covers more creative work, protects the creative work
more broadly, and protects works that are based in a significant way
on the initial creative work.

<para>
At the same time that the scope of copyright has expanded, procedural
limitations on the right have been relaxed. I've already described the
complete removal of the renewal requirement in 1992. In addition
<!-- PAGE BREAK 148 -->
to the renewal requirement, for most of the history of American
copyright law, there was a requirement that a work be registered
before it could receive the protection of a copyright. There was also
a requirement that any copyrighted work be marked either with that
famous &copy; or the word <emphasis>copyright</emphasis>. And for most
of the history of American copyright law, there was a requirement that
works be deposited with the government before a copyright could be
secured.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxderivativeworkshistoricalshiftincopyrightcoverageof' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
The reason for the registration requirement was the sensible
understanding that for most works, no copyright was required. Again,
in the first ten years of the Republic, 95 percent of works eligible
for copyright were never copyrighted. Thus, the rule reflected the
norm: Most works apparently didn't need copyright, so registration
narrowed the regulation of the law to the few that did. The same
reasoning justified the requirement that a work be marked as
copyrighted&mdash;that way it was easy to know whether a copyright was
being claimed. The requirement that works be deposited was to assure
that after the copyright expired, there would be a copy of the work
somewhere so that it could be copied by others without locating the
original author.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>copyright law</primary><secondary>European</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
All of these <quote>formalities</quote> were abolished in the American system when
we decided to follow European copyright law. There is no requirement
that you register a work to get a copyright; the copyright now is
automatic; the copyright exists whether or not you mark your work with
a &copy;; and the copyright exists whether or not you actually make a
copy available for others to copy.

<para>
If, in 1790, you wrote a book and you were one of the 5 percent who
actually copyrighted that book, then the copyright law protected you
against another publisher's taking your book and republishing it
without your permission. The aim of the act was to regulate publishers
so as to prevent that kind of unfair competition. In 1790, there were
174 publishers in the United States.<footnote><para>

Creation of American Literature,</quote> 29 <citetitle>New York University Journal of

Federal Copyright Records, 1790&ndash;1800 (U.S. G.P.O., 1987).

The Copyright Act was thus a tiny
regulation of a tiny proportion of a tiny part of the creative market in

The act left other creators totally unregulated. If I copied your poem
by hand, over and over again, as a way to learn it by heart, my act
was totally unregulated by the 1790 act. If I took your novel and made
a play based upon it, or if I translated it or abridged it, none of
those activities were regulated by the original copyright act. These
creative activities remained free, while the activities of publishers
were restrained.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxcopyrightact2' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
Today the story is very different: If you write a book, your book is
automatically protected. Indeed, not just your book. Every e-mail,
every note to your spouse, every doodle, <emphasis>every</emphasis>
creative act that's reduced to a tangible form&mdash;all of this is
automatically copyrighted.  There is no need to register or mark your
work. The protection follows the creation, not the steps you take to
protect it.
</para>
<para>
That protection gives you the right (subject to a narrow range of
fair use exceptions) to control how others copy the work, whether they
copy it to republish it or to share an excerpt.
</para>
<para>
That much is the obvious part. Any system of copyright would 
		control
competing publishing. But there's a second part to the copyright of
today that is not at all obvious. This is the protection of <quote>derivative
rights.</quote> If you write a book, no one can make a movie out of your
book without permission. No one can translate it without permission.
CliffsNotes can't make an abridgment unless permission is granted. All
of these derivative uses of your original work are controlled by the
copyright holder. The copyright, in other words, is now not just an 
		exclusive
right to your writings, but an exclusive right to your writings
and a large proportion of the writings inspired by them.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxderivativeworkspiracyvs3' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
It is this derivative right that would seem most bizarre to our
framers, though it has become second nature to us. Initially, this 
		expansion
was created to deal with obvious evasions of a narrower 
		copyright.
If I write a book, can you change one word and then claim a
copyright in a new and different book? Obviously that would make a
joke of the copyright, so the law was properly expanded to include
those slight modifications as well as the verbatim original work.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 150 -->
In preventing that joke, the law created an astonishing power
within a free culture&mdash;at least, it's astonishing when you
understand that the law applies not just to the commercial publisher
but to anyone with a computer. I understand the wrong in duplicating
and selling someone else's work. But whatever
<emphasis>that</emphasis> wrong is, transforming someone else's work
is a different wrong. Some view transformation as no wrong at
all&mdash;they believe that our law, as the framers penned it, should
not protect derivative rights at all.<footnote><para>

Whether or not you go that far, it seems
plain that whatever wrong is involved is fundamentally different from
the wrong of direct piracy.

Professor Rubenfeld has presented a powerful constitutional argument

perspective of the First Amendment) between mere <quote>copies</quote> and
derivative works. See Jed Rubenfeld, <quote>The Freedom of Imagination:

This again may seem right to you. If I wrote a book, then why should

toys and be the one to trade on the value that Disney originally
created?
</para>

These are good arguments, and, in general, my point is not that the
derivative right is unjustified. My aim just now is much narrower:
simply to make clear that this expansion is a significant change from
the rights originally granted.

This is a simplification of the law, but not much of one. The law
certainly regulates more than <quote>copies</quote>&mdash;a public performance of a
copyrighted song, for example, is regulated even though performance
per se doesn't make a copy; 17 <citetitle>United States Code</citetitle>, section
106(4). And it certainly sometimes doesn't regulate a <quote>copy</quote>; 17
<citetitle>United States Code</citetitle>, section 112(a). But the presumption under the

about. For while it may be obvious that in the world before the

This is perhaps the central claim of this book, so let me take this
very slowly so that the point is not easily missed. My claim is that the

the law of copyright automatically applies,<footnote><para>

Thus, my argument is not that in each place that copyright law
extends, we should repeal it. It is instead that we should have a good
argument for its extending where it does, and should not determine its
reach on the basis of arbitrary and automatic changes caused by
technology.

Think about a book in real space, and imagine this circle to represent

you read a book, that act is not regulated by copyright law. If you
give someone the book, that act is not regulated by copyright law. If
you resell a book, that act is not regulated (copyright law expressly
states that after the first sale of a book, the copyright owner can
impose no further conditions on the disposition of the book). If you
sleep on the book or use it to hold up a lamp or let your puppy chew
it up, those acts are not regulated by copyright law, because those

Obviously, however, some uses of a copyrighted book are regulated

is therefore regulated by copyright law. Indeed, this particular use stands

quoting makes a copy. That copy would ordinarily give the copyright

In real space, then, the possible uses of a book are divided into three
sorts: (1) unregulated uses, (2) regulated uses, and (3) regulated uses that
are nonetheless deemed <quote>fair</quote> regardless of the copyright owner's views.

Enter the Internet&mdash;a distributed, digital network where every use
of a copyrighted work produces a copy.<footnote><para>
<!-- f18 -->
I don't mean <quote>nature</quote> in the sense that it couldn't be different, but
rather that its present instantiation entails a copy. Optical networks
need not make copies of content they transmit, and a digital network
could be designed to delete anything it copies so that the same number
of copies remain.
</para></footnote>
And because of this single, arbitrary feature of the design of a
digital network, the scope of category 1 changes dramatically. Uses
that before were presumptively unregulated are now presumptively
regulated. No longer is there a set of presumptively unregulated uses
that define a freedom associated with a copyrighted work. Instead,
each use is now subject to the copyright, because each use also makes
a copy&mdash;category 1 gets sucked into category 2. And those who
would defend the unregulated uses of copyrighted work must look
exclusively to category 3, fair uses, to bear the burden of this
shift.

So let's be very specific to make this general point clear. Before the
Internet, if you purchased a book and read it ten times, there would
be no plausible <emphasis>copyright</emphasis>-related argument that
the copyright owner could make to control that use of her
book. Copyright law would have nothing to say about whether you read
the book once, ten times, or every
<!-- PAGE BREAK 155 -->
night before you went to bed. None of those instances of
use&mdash;reading&mdash; could be regulated by copyright law because
none of those uses produced a copy.

<para>
But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a different
set of rules. Now if the copyright owner says you may read the book
only once or only once a month, then <emphasis>copyright
law</emphasis> would aid the copyright owner in exercising this degree
of control, because of the accidental feature of copyright law that
triggers its application upon there being a copy. Now if you read the
book ten times and the license says you may read it only five times,
then whenever you read the book (or any portion of it) beyond the
fifth time, you are making a copy of the book contrary to the
copyright owner's wish.

<para>
There are some people who think this makes perfect sense. My aim
just now is not to argue about whether it makes sense or not. My aim
is only to make clear the change. Once you see this point, a few other
points also become clear:
</para>
<para>
First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy maker
ever intended. Congress did not think through the collapse of the
presumptively unregulated uses of copyrighted works. There is no
evidence at all that policy makers had this idea in mind when they
allowed our policy here to shift. Unregulated uses were an important
part of free culture before the Internet.
</para>
<indexterm id='idxcopyrightlawonrepublishingvstransformationoforiginalwork3' class='startofrange'><primary>copyright law</primary><secondary>on republishing vs. transformation of original work</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of
transformative uses of creative content. Again, we can all understand
the wrong in commercial piracy. But the law now purports to regulate
<emphasis>any</emphasis> transformation you make of creative work
using a machine. <quote>Copy and paste</quote> and <quote>cut and paste</quote> become
crimes. Tinkering with a story and releasing it to others exposes the
tinkerer to at least a requirement of justification.  However
troubling the expansion with respect to copying a particular work, it
is extraordinarily troubling with respect to transformative uses of
creative work.

<indexterm id='idxderivativeworksfairusevs' class='startofrange'><primary>derivative works</primary><secondary>fair use vs.</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an extraordinary

<!-- PAGE BREAK 156 -->
burden on category 3 (<quote>fair use</quote>) that fair use never before had to
bear.  If a copyright owner now tried to control how many times I
could read a book on-line, the natural response would be to argue that
this is a violation of my fair use rights. But there has never been
any litigation about whether I have a fair use right to read, because
before the Internet, reading did not trigger the application of
copyright law and hence the need for a fair use defense. The right to
read was effectively protected before because reading was not
regulated.

This point about fair use is totally ignored, even by advocates for
free culture. We have been cornered into arguing that our rights
depend upon fair use&mdash;never even addressing the earlier question
about the expansion in effective regulation. A thin protection
grounded in fair use makes sense when the vast majority of uses are
<emphasis>unregulated</emphasis>. But when everything becomes
presumptively regulated, then the protections of fair use are not
enough.

The case of Video Pipeline is a good example. Video Pipeline was
in the business of making <quote>trailer</quote> advertisements for movies available

the trailers on tape, and sold the tapes to the retail stores.

In 1998, Video Pipeline informed Disney and other film distributors
that it intended to distribute the trailers through the Internet
(rather than sending the tapes) to distributors of their videos. Two
years later, Disney told Video Pipeline to stop. The owner of Video
<!-- PAGE BREAK 157 -->
Pipeline asked Disney to talk about the matter&mdash;he had built a
business on distributing this content as a way to help sell Disney
films; he had customers who depended upon his delivering this
content. Disney would agree to talk only if Video Pipeline stopped the
distribution immediately.  Video Pipeline thought it was within their
<quote>fair use</quote> rights to distribute the clips as they had. So they filed a
lawsuit to ask the court to declare that these rights were in fact
their rights.

<para>
Disney countersued&mdash;for $100 million in damages. Those damages
were predicated upon a claim that Video Pipeline had <quote>willfully
infringed</quote> on Disney's copyright. When a court makes a finding of
willful infringement, it can award damages not on the basis of the
actual harm to the copyright owner, but on the basis of an amount set
in the statute. Because Video Pipeline had distributed seven hundred
clips of Disney movies to enable video stores to sell copies of those
movies, Disney was now suing Video Pipeline for $100 million.
</para>
<para>
Disney has the right to control its property, of course. But the video
stores that were selling Disney's films also had some sort of right to be
able to sell the films that they had bought from Disney. Disney's claim
in court was that the stores were allowed to sell the films and they were
permitted to list the titles of the films they were selling, but they were
not allowed to show clips of the films as a way of selling them without
Disney's permission.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>first-sale doctrine</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Now, you might think this is a close case, and I think the courts
would consider it a close case. My point here is to map the change
that gives Disney this power. Before the Internet, Disney couldn't
really control how people got access to their content. Once a video
was in the marketplace, the <quote>first-sale doctrine</quote> would free the
seller to use the video as he wished, including showing portions of it
in order to engender sales of the entire movie video. But with the
Internet, it becomes possible for Disney to centralize control over
access to this content. Because each use of the Internet produces a
copy, use on the Internet becomes subject to the copyright owner's
control. The technology expands the scope of effective control,
because the technology builds a copy into every transaction.

<!-- PAGE BREAK 158 -->
No doubt, a potential is not yet an abuse, and so the potential for
control is not yet the abuse of control. Barnes &amp; Noble has the
right to say you can't touch a book in their store; property law gives
them that right.  But the market effectively protects against that
abuse. If Barnes &amp; Noble banned browsing, then consumers would
choose other bookstores.  Competition protects against the
extremes. And it may well be (my argument so far does not even
question this) that competition would prevent any similar danger when
it comes to copyright. Sure, publishers exercising the rights that
authors have assigned to them might try to regulate how many times you
read a book, or try to stop you from sharing the book with anyone. But
in a competitive market such as the book market, the dangers of this
happening are quite slight.
</para>
<para>
Again, my aim so far is simply to map the changes that this changed
architecture enables. Enabling technology to enforce the control of
copyright means that the control of copyright is no longer defined by
balanced policy. The control of copyright is simply what private
owners choose. In some contexts, at least, that fact is harmless. But
in some contexts it is a recipe for disaster.

The disappearance of unregulated uses would be change enough, but a

An absurd and hollow threat, of course, because Warner Brothers,
like the Marx Brothers, knew that no court would ever enforce such a
silly claim. This extremism was irrelevant to the real freedoms anyone

On the Internet, however, there is no check on silly rules, because on
the Internet, increasingly, rules are enforced not by a human but by a
machine: Increasingly, the rules of copyright law, as interpreted by
the copyright owner, get built into the technology that delivers
copyrighted content. It is code, rather than law, that rules. And the
problem with code regulations is that, unlike law, code has no
shame. Code would not get the humor of the Marx Brothers. The
consequence of that is not at all funny.

Now, the Adobe eBook Reader calls these controls

law. But for work not under copyright, there is no such copyright
power.<footnote><para>
<!-- f21 -->
In principle, a contract might impose a requirement on me. I might,
for example, buy a book from you that includes a contract that says I
will read it only three times, or that I promise to read it three
times. But that obligation (and the limits for creating that
obligation) would come from the contract, not from copyright law, and
the obligations of contract would not necessarily pass to anyone who
subsequently acquired the book.

When my e-book of <citetitle>Middlemarch</citetitle> says I have the
permission to copy only ten text selections into the memory every ten
days, what that really means is that the eBook Reader has enabled the
publisher to control how I use the book on my computer, far beyond the
control that the law would enable.
</para>
<para>
The control comes instead from the code&mdash;from the technology
within which the e-book <quote>lives.</quote> Though the e-book says that these are
permissions, they are not the sort of <quote>permissions</quote> that most of us
deal with. When a teenager gets <quote>permission</quote> to stay out till
midnight, she knows (unless she's Cinderella) that she can stay out
till 2 A.M., but will suffer a punishment if she's caught. But when
the Adobe eBook Reader says I have the permission to make ten copies
of the text into the computer's memory, that means that after I've
made ten copies, the computer will not make any more. The same with
the printing restrictions: After ten pages, the eBook Reader will not
print any more pages.  It's the same with the silly restriction that
says that you can't use the Read Aloud button to read my book
aloud&mdash;it's not that the company will sue you if you do; instead,
if you push the Read Aloud button with my book, the machine simply
won't read aloud.

These are <emphasis>controls</emphasis>, not permissions. Imagine a

<para>
This is the future of copyright law: not so much copyright
<emphasis>law</emphasis> as copyright <emphasis>code</emphasis>. The
controls over access to content will not be controls that are ratified
by courts; the controls over access to content will be controls that
are coded by programmers. And whereas the controls that are built into
the law are always to be checked by a judge, the controls that are
built into the technology have no similar built-in check.
</para>
<para>
How significant is this? Isn't it always possible to get around the
controls built into the technology? Software used to be sold with
technologies that limited the ability of users to copy the software,
but those were trivial protections to defeat. Why won't it be trivial
to defeat these protections as well?

</para>
<para>
The public relations nightmare attached to that final permission.
For the text did not say that you were not permitted to use the Read
Aloud button; it said you did not have the permission to read the book
aloud. That led some people to think that Adobe was restricting the
right of parents, for example, to read the book to their children, which
seemed, to say the least, absurd.
</para>
<para>
Adobe responded quickly that it was absurd to think that it was trying
to restrict the right to read a book aloud. Obviously it was only
restricting the ability to use the Read Aloud button to have the book
read aloud. But the question Adobe never did answer is this: Would
Adobe thus agree that a consumer was free to use software to hack
around the restrictions built into the eBook Reader? If some company
(call it Elcomsoft) developed a program to disable the technological
protection built into an Adobe eBook so that a blind person, say,
could use a computer to read the book aloud, would Adobe agree that
such a use of an eBook Reader was fair? Adobe didn't answer because
the answer, however absurd it might seem, is no.

often crazy.

them, <citetitle>hack</citetitle> is a much more positive

He and a group of colleagues were working on a paper to be submitted
at conference.  The paper was intended to describe the weakness in an
encryption system being developed by the Secure Digital Music
Initiative as a technique to control the distribution of music.
</para>
<para>
The SDMI coalition had as its goal a technology to enable content
owners to exercise much better control over their content than the
Internet, as it originally stood, granted them. Using encryption, SDMI
hoped to develop a standard that would allow the content owner to say
<quote>this music cannot be copied,</quote> and have a computer respect that
command.  The technology was to be part of a <quote>trusted system</quote> of
control that would get content owners to trust the system of the
Internet much more.

When SDMI thought it was close to a standard, it set up a competition.
In exchange for providing contestants with the code to an
SDMI-encrypted bit of content, contestants were to try to crack it
and, if they did, report the problems to the consortium.

Felten and his team figured out the encryption system quickly. He and

systems would suffer the same weakness, and Felten and his team
thought it worthwhile to point this out to those who study encryption.

Let's review just what Felten was doing. Again, this is the United
States. We have a principle of free speech. We have this principle not
just because it is the law, but also because it is a really great
idea. A strongly protected tradition of free speech is likely to
encourage a wide range of criticism. That criticism is likely, in
turn, to improve the systems or people or ideas criticized.
</para>
<para>
What Felten and his colleagues were doing was publishing a paper
describing the weakness in a technology. They were not spreading free
music, or building and deploying this technology. The paper was an
academic essay, unintelligible to most people. But it clearly showed the
weakness in the SDMI system, and why SDMI would not, as presently
constituted, succeed.

What links these two, aibopet.com and Felten, is the letters they
then received. Aibopet.com received a letter from Sony about the
aibopet.com hack. Though a jazz-dancing dog is perfectly legal, Sony
wrote:

And though an academic paper describing the weakness in a system

from an RIAA lawyer that read:

</blockquote>
<para>
In both cases, this weirdly Orwellian law was invoked to control the
spread of information. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act made
spreading such information an offense.
</para>
<para>
The DMCA was enacted as a response to copyright owners' first fear
about cyberspace. The fear was that copyright control was effectively
dead; the response was to find technologies that might compensate.
These new technologies would be copyright protection
technologies&mdash; technologies to control the replication and
distribution of copyrighted material. They were designed as
<emphasis>code</emphasis> to modify the original
<emphasis>code</emphasis> of the Internet, to reestablish some
protection for copyright owners.
</para>
<para>
The DMCA was a bit of law intended to back up the protection of this
code designed to protect copyrighted material. It was, we could say,
<emphasis>legal code</emphasis> intended to buttress
<emphasis>software code</emphasis> which itself was intended to
support the <emphasis>legal code of copyright</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
But the DMCA was not designed merely to protect copyrighted works to
the extent copyright law protected them. Its protection, that is, did
not end at the line that copyright law drew. The DMCA regulated
devices that were designed to circumvent copyright protection
measures. It was designed to ban those devices, whether or not the use
of the copyrighted material made possible by that circumvention would
have been a copyright violation.

<para>
Aibopet.com and Felten make the point. The Aibo hack circumvented a
copyright protection system for the purpose of enabling the dog to
dance jazz. That enablement no doubt involved the use of copyrighted
material. But as aibopet.com's site was noncommercial, and the use did
not enable subsequent copyright infringements, there's no doubt that
aibopet.com's hack was fair use of Sony's copyrighted material. Yet
fair use is not a defense to the DMCA. The question is not whether the
<!-- PAGE BREAK 169 -->
use of the copyrighted material was a copyright violation. The question
is whether a copyright protection system was circumvented.
</para>
<para>
The threat against Felten was more attenuated, but it followed the
same line of reasoning. By publishing a paper describing how a
copyright protection system could be circumvented, the RIAA lawyer
suggested, Felten himself was distributing a circumvention technology.
Thus, even though he was not himself infringing anyone's copyright,
his academic paper was enabling others to infringe others' copyright.

The bizarreness of these arguments is captured in a cartoon drawn in
1981 by Paul Conrad. At that time, a court in California had held that
the VCR could be banned because it was a copyright-infringing
technology: It enabled consumers to copy films without the permission

The anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA target copyright
circumvention technologies. Circumvention technologies can be used for
different ends. They can be used, for example, to enable massive
pirating of copyrighted material&mdash;a bad end. Or they can be used
to enable the use of particular copyrighted materials in ways that
would be considered fair use&mdash;a good end.

The Aibo and RIAA examples demonstrate how copyright owners are
changing the balance that copyright law grants. Using code, copyright
owners restrict fair use; using the DMCA, they punish those who would
attempt to evade the restrictions on fair use that they impose through
code. Technology becomes a means by which fair use can be erased; the
law of the DMCA backs up that erasing.
</para>
<para>
This is how <emphasis>code</emphasis> becomes
<emphasis>law</emphasis>. The controls built into the technology of
copy and access protection become rules the violation of which is also
a violation of the law. In this way, the code extends the
law&mdash;increasing its regulation, even if the subject it regulates
(activities that would otherwise plainly constitute fair use) is
beyond the reach of the law. Code becomes law; code extends the law;
code thus extends the control that copyright owners effect&mdash;at
least for those copyright holders with the lawyers who can write the
nasty letters that Felten and aibopet.com received.
</para>
<para>
There is one final aspect of the interaction between architecture and
law that contributes to the force of copyright's regulation. This is
the ease with which infringements of the law can be detected. For
contrary to the rhetoric common at the birth of cyberspace that on the
Internet, no one knows you're a dog, increasingly, given changing
technologies deployed on the Internet, it is easy to find the dog who
committed a legal wrong. The technologies of the Internet are open to
snoops as well as sharers, and the snoops are increasingly good at
tracking down the identity of those who violate the rules.

For example, imagine you were part of a <citetitle>Star Trek</citetitle> fan club. You
gathered every month to share trivia, and maybe to enact a kind of fan
fiction about the show. One person would play Spock, another, Captain
Kirk. The characters would begin with a plot from a real story, then
simply continue it.<footnote><para>

</para>
<para>
Before the Internet, this was, in effect, a totally unregulated
activity.  No matter what happened inside your club room, you would
never be interfered with by the copyright police. You were free in
that space to do as you wished with this part of our culture. You were
allowed to build on it as you wished without fear of legal control.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>bots</primary></indexterm>
<para>
But if you moved your club onto the Internet, and made it generally
available for others to join, the story would be very different. Bots
scouring the Net for trademark and copyright infringement would
quickly find your site. Your posting of fan fiction, depending upon
the ownership of the series that you're depicting, could well inspire
a lawyer's threat. And ignoring the lawyer's threat would be extremely
costly indeed.  The law of copyright is extremely efficient. The
penalties are severe, and the process is quick.
</para>
<para>
This change in the effective force of the law is caused by a change
in the ease with which the law can be enforced. That change too shifts
the law's balance radically. It is as if your car transmitted the speed at
which you traveled at every moment that you drove; that would be just
one step before the state started issuing tickets based upon the data you
transmitted. That is, in effect, what is happening here.

<title>Market: Concentration</title>
<para>
So copyright's duration has increased dramatically&mdash;tripled in
the past thirty years. And copyright's scope has increased as
well&mdash;from regulating only publishers to now regulating just
about everyone. And copyright's reach has changed, as every action
becomes a copy and hence presumptively regulated. And as technologists
find better ways
<!-- PAGE BREAK 173 -->
to control the use of content, and as copyright is increasingly
enforced through technology, copyright's force changes, too. Misuse is
easier to find and easier to control. This regulation of the creative
process, which began as a tiny regulation governing a tiny part of the
market for creative work, has become the single most important
regulator of creativity there is. It is a massive expansion in the
scope of the government's control over innovation and creativity; it
would be totally unrecognizable to those who gave birth to copyright's
control.
</para>
<para>
Still, in my view, all of these changes would not matter much if it
weren't for one more change that we must also consider. This is a
change that is in some sense the most familiar, though its significance
and scope are not well understood. It is the one that creates precisely the
reason to be concerned about all the other changes I have described.
</para>
<para>
This is the change in the concentration and integration of the media.
In the past twenty years, the nature of media ownership has undergone
a radical alteration, caused by changes in legal rules governing the
media.  Before this change happened, the different forms of media were
owned by separate media companies. Now, the media is increasingly
owned by only a few companies. Indeed, after the changes that the FCC
announced in June 2003, most expect that within a few years, we will
live in a world where just three companies control more than 85 percent
of the media.

The story with radio is even more dramatic. Before deregulation,
the nation's largest radio broadcasting conglomerate owned fewer than

seventy-five stations. Today <emphasis>one</emphasis> company owns
more than 1,200 stations.  During that period of consolidation, the
total number of radio owners dropped by 34 percent. Today, in most

Newspaper ownership is becoming more concentrated as well.  Today,
there are six hundred fewer daily newspapers in the United States than
there were eighty years ago, and ten companies control half of the
nation's circulation. There are twenty major newspaper publishers in
the United States. The top ten film studios receive 99 percent of all
film revenue. The ten largest cable companies account for 85 percent
of all cable revenue. This is a market far from the free press the
framers sought to protect. Indeed, it is a market that is quite well
protected&mdash; by the market.

Concentration in size alone is one thing. The more invidious
change is in the nature of that concentration. As author James Fallows
put it in a recent article about Rupert Murdoch,
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
Murdoch's companies now constitute a production system
unmatched in its integration. They supply content&mdash;Fox movies
&hellip;  Fox TV shows &hellip; Fox-controlled sports broadcasts, plus
newspapers and books. They sell the content to the public and to
advertisers&mdash;in newspapers, on the broadcast network, on the
cable channels. And they operate the physical distribution system
through which the content reaches the customers. Murdoch's satellite
systems now distribute News Corp. content in Europe and Asia; if
Murdoch becomes DirecTV's largest single owner, that system will serve
the same function in the United States.<footnote><para>

Does this concentration matter? Will it affect what is made, or
what is distributed? Or is it merely a more efficient way to produce and
distribute content?

My view was that concentration wouldn't matter. I thought it was
nothing more than a more efficient financial structure. But now, after

Rather than comply, Lear simply took the show elsewhere. CBS
was happy to have the series; ABC could not stop Lear from walking.

The network did not control those copyrights because the law forbade
the networks from controlling the content they syndicated. The law
required a separation between the networks and the content producers;
that separation would guarantee Lear freedom. And as late as 1992,
because of these rules, the vast majority of prime time

networks.

In 1994, the FCC abandoned the rules that required this independence.

constitutional protections because of the constant surveillance this

No. You cannot. Television stations have a general policy of avoiding
<quote>controversial</quote> ads. Ads sponsored by the government are deemed
uncontroversial; ads disagreeing with the government are
controversial.  This selectivity might be thought inconsistent with
the First Amendment, but the Supreme Court has held that stations have
the right to choose what they run. Thus, the major channels of
commercial media will refuse one side of a crucial debate the
opportunity to present its case.  And the courts will defend the
rights of the stations to be this biased.<footnote><para>

The Marijuana Policy Project, in February 2003, sought to place ads
that directly responded to the Nick and Norm series on stations within
the Washington, D.C., area. Comcast rejected the ads as <quote>against
[their] policy.</quote>  The local NBC affiliate, WRC, rejected the ads
without reviewing them. The local ABC affiliate, WJOA, originally
agreed to run the ads and accepted payment to do so, but later decided
not to run the ads and returned the collected fees. Interview with
Neal Levine, 15 October 2003.  These restrictions are, of course, not
limited to drug policy. See, for example, Nat Ives, <quote>On the
Issue of an Iraq War, Advocacy Ads Meet with Rejection from TV

I'd be happy to defend the networks' rights, as well&mdash;if we lived
in a media market that was truly diverse. But concentration in the
media throws that condition into doubt. If a handful of companies
control access to the media, and that handful of companies gets to
decide which political positions it will allow to be promoted on its
channels, then in an obvious and important way, concentration
matters. You might like the positions the handful of companies
selects. But you should not like a world in which a mere few get to
decide which issues the rest of us get to know about.

There is something innocent and obvious about the claim of the
copyright warriors that the government should <quote>protect my property.</quote>
In the abstract, it is obviously true and, ordinarily, totally
harmless. No sane sort who is not an anarchist could disagree.
</para>
<para>
But when we see how dramatically this <quote>property</quote> has changed&mdash;
when we recognize how it might now interact with both technology and
markets to mean that the effective constraint on the liberty to
cultivate our culture is dramatically different&mdash;the claim begins
to seem

<!-- PAGE BREAK 180 -->
less innocent and obvious. Given (1) the power of technology to
supplement the law's control, and (2) the power of concentrated
markets to weaken the opportunity for dissent, if strictly enforcing
the massively expanded <quote>property</quote> rights granted by copyright
fundamentally changes the freedom within this culture to cultivate and
build upon our past, then we have to ask whether this property should
be redefined.
</para>
<para>
Not starkly. Or absolutely. My point is not that we should abolish
copyright or go back to the eighteenth century. That would be a total
mistake, disastrous for the most important creative enterprises within
our culture today.
</para>
<para>
But there is a space between zero and one, Internet culture
notwithstanding.  And these massive shifts in the effective power of
copyright regulation, tied to increased concentration of the content
industry and resting in the hands of technology that will increasingly
enable control over the use of culture, should drive us to consider
whether another adjustment is called for. Not an adjustment that
increases copyright's power. Not an adjustment that increases its
term. Rather, an adjustment to restore the balance that has
traditionally defined copyright's regulation&mdash;a weakening of that
regulation, to strengthen creativity.
</para>
<para>
Copyright law has not been a rock of Gibraltar. It's not a set of
constant commitments that, for some mysterious reason, teenagers and
geeks now flout. Instead, copyright power has grown dramatically in a
short period of time, as the technologies of distribution and creation
have changed and as lobbyists have pushed for more control by
copyright holders. Changes in the past in response to changes in
technology suggest that we may well need similar changes in the
future. And these changes have to be <emphasis>reductions</emphasis>
in the scope of copyright, in response to the extraordinary increase
in control that technology and the market enable.
</para>
<para>
For the single point that is lost in this war on pirates is a point that
we see only after surveying the range of these changes. When you add
<!-- PAGE BREAK 181 -->
together the effect of changing law, concentrated markets, and
changing technology, together they produce an astonishing conclusion:
<emphasis>Never in our history have fewer had a legal right to control
more of the development of our culture than now</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
Not when copyrights were perpetual, for when copyrights were
perpetual, they affected only that precise creative work. Not when
only publishers had the tools to publish, for the market then was much
more diverse. Not when there were only three television networks, for
even then, newspapers, film studios, radio stations, and publishers
were independent of the networks. <emphasis>Never</emphasis> has
copyright protected such a wide range of rights, against as broad a
range of actors, for a term that was remotely as long. This form of
regulation&mdash;a tiny regulation of a tiny part of the creative
energy of a nation at the founding&mdash;is now a massive regulation
of the overall creative process. Law plus technology plus the market
now interact to turn this historically benign regulation into the most
significant regulation of culture that our free society has
known.<footnote><para>

<para>
At the start of this book, I distinguished between commercial and
noncommercial culture. In the course of this chapter, I have
distinguished between copying a work and transforming it. We can now
combine these two distinctions and draw a clear map of the changes
that copyright law has undergone.  In 1790, the law looked like this:

The act of publishing a map, chart, and book was regulated by
copyright law. Nothing else was. Transformations were free. And as
copyright attached only with registration, and only those who intended

<!-- PAGE BREAK 182 -->
to benefit commercially would register, copying through publishing of
noncommercial work was also free.
</para>
<para>
By the end of the nineteenth century, the law had changed to this:

Derivative works were now regulated by copyright law&mdash;if
published, which again, given the economics of publishing at the time,
means if offered commercially. But noncommercial publishing and
transformation were still essentially free.
</para>
<para>
In 1909 the law changed to regulate copies, not publishing, and after
this change, the scope of the law was tied to technology. As the
technology of copying became more prevalent, the reach of the law
expanded.  Thus by 1975, as photocopying machines became more common,
we could say the law began to look like this:

The law was interpreted to reach noncommercial copying through, say,
copy machines, but still much of copying outside of the commercial

technologies, especially in the context of a digital network, means
that the law now looks like this:

<para>
Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas before most
creativity was not. The law now regulates the full range of
creativity&mdash;
<!-- PAGE BREAK 183 -->
commercial or not, transformative or not&mdash;with the same rules
designed to regulate commercial publishers.
</para>
<para>
Obviously, copyright law is not the enemy. The enemy is regulation
that does no good. So the question that we should be asking just now
is whether extending the regulations of copyright law into each of
these domains actually does any good.
</para>
<para>
I have no doubt that it does good in regulating commercial copying.
But I also have no doubt that it does more harm than good when
regulating (as it regulates just now) noncommercial copying and,
especially, noncommercial transformation. And increasingly, for the
reasons sketched especially in chapters
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="recorders"/> and
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="transformers"/>, one
might well wonder whether it does more harm than good for commercial
transformation.  More commercial transformative work would be created
if derivative rights were more sharply restricted.
</para>
<para>
The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property. Of
course copyright is a kind of <quote>property,</quote> and of course, as with any
property, the state ought to protect it. But first impressions
notwithstanding, historically, this property right (as with all
property rights<footnote><para>
<!-- f36 -->
<indexterm><primary>legal realist movement</primary></indexterm>
It was the single most important contribution of the legal realist
movement to demonstrate that all property rights are always crafted to
balance public and private interests. See Thomas C. Grey, <quote>The
Disintegration of Property,</quote> in <citetitle>Nomos XXII: Property</citetitle>, J. Roland
Pennock and John W.  Chapman, eds. (New York: New York University
Press, 1980).
</para></footnote>)
has been crafted to balance the important need to give authors and
artists incentives with the equally important need to assure access to
creative work. This balance has always been struck in light of new
technologies.  And for almost half of our tradition, the <quote>copyright</quote>
did not control <emphasis>at all</emphasis> the freedom of others to
build upon or transform a creative work. American culture was born
free, and for almost 180 years our country consistently protected a
vibrant and rich free culture.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>archives, digital</primary></indexterm>
<para>
We achieved that free culture because our law respected important
limits on the scope of the interests protected by <quote>property.</quote> The very
birth of <quote>copyright</quote> as a statutory right recognized those limits, by
granting copyright owners protection for a limited time only (the
story of chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="founders"/>). The tradition of <quote>fair use</quote> is
animated by a similar concern that is increasingly under strain as the
costs of exercising any fair use right become unavoidably high (the
story of chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="recorders"/>). Adding
<!-- PAGE BREAK 184 -->
statutory rights where markets might stifle innovation is another
familiar limit on the property right that copyright is (chapter <xref
xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="transformers"/>). And
granting archives and libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of
property notwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing the soul
of a culture (chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="collectors"/>). Free cultures, like free markets, are built
with property. But the nature of the property that builds a free
culture is very different from the extremist vision that dominates the
debate today.
</para>
<para>
Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy. In
response to a real, if not yet quantified, threat that the
technologies of the Internet present to twentieth-century business
models for producing and distributing culture, the law and technology
are being transformed in a way that will undermine our tradition of
free culture. The property right that is copyright is no longer the
balanced right that it was, or was intended to be. The property right
that is copyright has become unbalanced, tilted toward an extreme. The
opportunity to create and transform becomes weakened in a world in
which creation requires permission and creativity must check with a
lawyer.

The valley is extraordinarily beautiful, with <quote>sweet water, pasture,

sight to the villagers. They don't understand. He tells them they are
<quote>blind.</quote> They don't have the word <citetitle>blind</citetitle>. They think he's just thick.
Indeed, as they increasingly notice the things he can't do (hear the

The villagers don't leave him alone. Nor do they see (so to speak) the
virtue of his special power. Not even the ultimate target of his
affection, a young woman who to him seems <quote>the most beautiful thing in
the whole of creation,</quote> understands the beauty of sight. Nunez's
description of what he sees <quote>seemed to her the most poetical of
fancies, and she listened to his description of the stars and the

<emphasis role='strong'>It sometimes</emphasis> happens that the eggs

Before I had read about chimeras, I would have said they were
impossible.  A single person can't have two sets of DNA. The very idea
of DNA is that it is the code of an individual. Yet in fact, not only
can two individuals have the same set of DNA (identical twins), but
one person can have two different sets of DNA (a chimera). Our
understanding of a <quote>person</quote> should reflect this reality.
</para>
<para>
The more I work to understand the current struggle over copyright and
culture, which I've sometimes called unfairly, and sometimes not
unfairly enough, <quote>the copyright wars,</quote> the more I think we're dealing
with a chimera. For example, in the battle over the question <quote>What is
p2p file sharing?</quote> both sides have it right, and both sides have it
wrong.  One side says, <quote>File sharing is just like two kids taping each
others' records&mdash;the sort of thing we've been doing for the last
thirty years without any question at all.</quote> That's true, at least in
part. When I tell my best friend to try out a new CD that I've bought,
but rather than just send the CD, I point him to my p2p server, that
is, in all relevant respects, just like what every executive in every
recording company no doubt did as a kid: sharing music.
</para>
<para>
But the description is also false in part. For when my p2p server is
on a p2p network through which anyone can get access to my music, then
sure, my friends can get access, but it stretches the meaning of
<quote>friends</quote> beyond recognition to say <quote>my ten thousand best friends</quote> can
get access. Whether or not sharing my music with my best friend is
what <quote>we have always been allowed to do,</quote> we have not always been
allowed to share music with <quote>our ten thousand best friends.</quote>
</para>
<para>
Likewise, when the other side says, <quote>File sharing is just like walking
into a Tower Records and taking a CD off the shelf and walking out
with it,</quote> that's true, at least in part. If, after Lyle Lovett
(finally) releases a new album, rather than buying it, I go to Kazaa
and find a free copy to take, that is very much like stealing a copy
from Tower.
<indexterm><primary>Lovett, Lyle</primary></indexterm>
</para>
<para>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 189 -->
But it is not quite stealing from Tower. After all, when I take a CD
from Tower Records, Tower has one less CD to sell. And when I take a
CD from Tower Records, I get a bit of plastic and a cover, and
something to show on my shelves. (And, while we're at it, we could
also note that when I take a CD from Tower Records, the maximum fine
that might be imposed on me, under California law, at least, is
$1,000.  According to the RIAA, by contrast, if I download a ten-song
CD, I'm liable for $1,500,000 in damages.)
</para>
<para>
The point is not that it is as neither side describes. The point is
that it is both&mdash;both as the RIAA describes it and as Kazaa
describes it. It is a chimera. And rather than simply denying what the
other side asserts, we need to begin to think about how we should
respond to this chimera. What rules should govern it?
</para>
<para>
We could respond by simply pretending that it is not a chimera. We
could, with the RIAA, decide that every act of file sharing should be
a felony. We could prosecute families for millions of dollars in
damages just because file sharing occurred on a family computer. And
we can get universities to monitor all computer traffic to make sure
that no computer is used to commit this crime. These responses might
be extreme, but each of them has either been proposed or actually
implemented.<footnote><para>

Alternatively, we could respond to file sharing the way many kids act
as though we've responded. We could totally legalize it. Let there be
no copyright liability, either civil or criminal, for making
copyrighted content available on the Net. Make file sharing like
gossip: regulated, if at all, by social norms but not by law.
</para>
<para>
Either response is possible. I think either would be a mistake.
Rather than embrace one of these two extremes, we should embrace
something that recognizes the truth in both. And while I end this book
with a sketch of a system that does just that, my aim in the next
chapter is to show just how awful it would be for us to adopt the
zero-tolerance extreme. I believe <emphasis>either</emphasis> extreme
would be worse than a reasonable alternative.  But I believe the
zero-tolerance solution would be the worse of the two extremes.
</para>
<para>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 190 -->
Yet zero tolerance is increasingly our government's policy. In the
middle of the chaos that the Internet has created, an extraordinary
land grab is occurring. The law and technology are being shifted to
give content holders a kind of control over our culture that they have
never had before. And in this extremism, many an opportunity for new
innovation and new creativity will be lost.
</para>
<para>
I'm not talking about the opportunities for kids to <quote>steal</quote> music. My
focus instead is the commercial and cultural innovation that this war
will also kill. We have never seen the power to innovate spread so
broadly among our citizens, and we have just begun to see the
innovation that this power will unleash. Yet the Internet has already
seen the passing of one cycle of innovation around technologies to
distribute content. The law is responsible for this passing. As the
vice president for global public policy at one of these new
innovators, eMusic.com, put it when criticizing the DMCA's added
protection for copyrighted material,
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
eMusic opposes music piracy. We are a distributor of copyrighted
material, and we want to protect those rights.
</para>
<para>
But building a technology fortress that locks in the clout of the
major labels is by no means the only way to protect copyright
interests, nor is it necessarily the best. It is simply too early to
answer that question. Market forces operating naturally may very well
produce a totally different industry model.
</para>
<para>
This is a critical point. The choices that industry sectors make
with respect to these systems will in many ways directly shape the
market for digital media and the manner in which digital media
are distributed. This in turn will directly influence the options
that are available to consumers, both in terms of the ease with
which they will be able to access digital media and the equipment
that they will require to do so. Poor choices made this early in the
game will retard the growth of this market, hurting everyone's
interests.<footnote><para>

In the next ten years we will see an explosion of digital
technologies.  These technologies will enable almost anyone to capture
and share content. Capturing and sharing content, of course, is what
humans have done since the dawn of man. It is how we learn and
communicate. But capturing and sharing through digital technology is
different. The fidelity and power are different. You could send an
e-mail telling someone about a joke you saw on Comedy Central, or you
could send the clip. You could write an essay about the
inconsistencies in the arguments of the politician you most love to
hate, or you could make a short film that puts statement against
statement. You could write a poem to express your love, or you could
weave together a string&mdash;a mash-up&mdash; of songs from your
favorite artists in a collage and make it available on the Net.

This digital <quote>capturing and sharing</quote> is in part an extension of the

and in part it is something new. It is continuous with the Kodak, but
it explodes the boundaries of Kodak-like technologies. The technology
of digital <quote>capturing and sharing</quote> promises a world of extraordinarily

to criticize politicians or businesses; sites that gather newspaper articles
on remote topics of science or culture. There is a vast amount of creative

was the case in the Soviet Union, though for very different reasons,
we will begin to see a world of underground art&mdash;not because the

fraught. Already, exhibits of <quote>illegal art</quote> tour the United

Part of the reason for this fear of illegality has to do with the
changing law. I described that change in detail in chapter
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="property-i"/>. But an
even bigger part has to do with the increasing ease with which
infractions can be tracked. As users of file-sharing systems
discovered in 2002, it is a trivial matter for copyright owners to get
courts to order Internet service providers to reveal who has what
content. It is as if your cassette tape player transmitted a list of
the songs that you played in the privacy of your own home that anyone
could tune into for whatever reason they chose.

Never in our history has a painter had to worry about whether
his painting infringed on someone else's work; but the modern-day
painter, using the tools of Photoshop, sharing content on the Web,
must worry all the time. Images are all around, but the only safe images
to use in the act of creation are those purchased from Corbis or another
image farm. And in purchasing, censoring happens. There is a free
market in pencils; we needn't worry about its effect on creativity. But
there is a highly regulated, monopolized market in cultural icons; the
right to cultivate and transform them is not similarly free.
</para>
<para>
Lawyers rarely see this because lawyers are rarely empirical. As I
described in chapter
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="recorders"/>, in
response to the story about documentary filmmaker Jon Else, I have
been lectured again and again by lawyers who insist Else's use was
fair use, and hence I am wrong to say that the law regulates such a
use.
</para>
<para>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 196 -->
But fair use in America simply means the right to hire a lawyer to
defend your right to create. And as lawyers love to forget, our system
for defending rights such as fair use is astonishingly bad&mdash;in
practically every context, but especially here. It costs too much, it
delivers too slowly, and what it delivers often has little connection
to the justice underlying the claim. The legal system may be tolerable
for the very rich.  For everyone else, it is an embarrassment to a
tradition that prides itself on the rule of law.
</para>
<para>
Judges and lawyers can tell themselves that fair use provides adequate
<quote>breathing room</quote> between regulation by the law and the access the law
should allow. But it is a measure of how out of touch our legal system
has become that anyone actually believes this. The rules that
publishers impose upon writers, the rules that film distributors
impose upon filmmakers, the rules that newspapers impose upon
journalists&mdash; these are the real laws governing creativity. And
these rules have little relationship to the <quote>law</quote> with which judges
comfort themselves.
</para>
<para>
For in a world that threatens $150,000 for a single willful
infringement of a copyright, and which demands tens of thousands of
dollars to even defend against a copyright infringement claim, and
which would never return to the wrongfully accused defendant anything
of the costs she suffered to defend her right to speak&mdash;in that
world, the astonishingly broad regulations that pass under the name
<quote>copyright</quote> silence speech and creativity. And in that world, it takes
a studied blindness for people to continue to believe they live in a
culture that is free.

<para>
The charge I've been making about the regulation of culture is the
same charge free marketers make about regulating markets. Everyone, of
course, concedes that some regulation of markets is necessary&mdash;at
a minimum, we need rules of property and contract, and courts to
enforce both. Likewise, in this culture debate, everyone concedes that
at least some framework of copyright is also required. But both
perspectives vehemently insist that just because some regulation is
good, it doesn't follow that more regulation is better. And both
perspectives are constantly attuned to the ways in which regulation
simply enables the powerful industries of today to protect themselves
against the competitors of tomorrow.

<para>
In 1997, Michael Roberts launched a company called MP3.com.  MP3.com
was keen to remake the music business. Their goal was not just to
facilitate new ways to get access to content. Their goal was also to
facilitate new ways to create content. Unlike the major labels,
MP3.com offered creators a venue to distribute their creativity,
without demanding an exclusive engagement from the creators.

<indexterm id='idxcdsprefdata' class='startofrange'><primary>CDs</primary><secondary>preference data on</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
To make this system work, however, MP3.com needed a reliable way to
recommend music to its users. The idea behind this alternative was to
leverage the revealed preferences of music listeners to recommend new
artists. If you like Lyle Lovett, you're likely to enjoy Bonnie
Raitt. And so on.
</para>
<para>
This idea required a simple way to gather data about user preferences.
MP3.com came up with an extraordinarily clever way to gather this
preference data. In January 2000, the company launched a service
called my.mp3.com. Using software provided by MP3.com, a user would
sign into an account and then insert into her computer a CD. The
software would identify the CD, and then give the user access to that
content.  So, for example, if you inserted a CD by Jill Sobule, then
wherever you were&mdash;at work or at home&mdash;you could get access
to that music once you signed into your account. The system was
therefore a kind of music-lockbox.
</para>
<para>
No doubt some could use this system to illegally copy content. But
that opportunity existed with or without MP3.com. The aim of the

<!-- PAGE BREAK 199 -->
my.mp3.com service was to give users access to their own content, and
as a by-product, by seeing the content they already owned, to discover
the kind of content the users liked.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxcdsprefdata' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
To make this system function, however, MP3.com needed to copy 50,000
CDs to a server. (In principle, it could have been the user who
uploaded the music, but that would have taken a great deal of time,
and would have produced a product of questionable quality.) It
therefore purchased 50,000 CDs from a store, and started the process
of making copies of those CDs. Again, it would not serve the content
from those copies to anyone except those who authenticated that they
had a copy of the CD they wanted to access. So while this was 50,000
copies, it was 50,000 copies directed at giving customers something
they had already bought.

Nine days after MP3.com launched its service, the five major labels,
headed by the RIAA, brought a lawsuit against MP3.com. MP3.com settled
with four of the five. Nine months later, a federal judge found
MP3.com to have been guilty of willful infringement with respect to
the fifth. Applying the law as it is, the judge imposed a fine against
MP3.com of $118 million. MP3.com then settled with the remaining
plaintiff, Vivendi Universal, paying over $54 million. Vivendi
purchased MP3.com just about a year later.
</para>
<para>
That part of the story I have told before. Now consider its conclusion.

<para>
After Vivendi purchased MP3.com, Vivendi turned around and filed a
malpractice lawsuit against the lawyers who had advised it that they
had a good faith claim that the service they wanted to offer would be
considered legal under copyright law. This lawsuit alleged that it
should have been obvious that the courts would find this behavior
illegal; therefore, this lawsuit sought to punish any lawyer who had
dared to suggest that the law was less restrictive than the labels
demanded.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxvivendiuniversal' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
The clear purpose of this lawsuit (which was settled for an
unspecified amount shortly after the story was no longer covered in
the press) was to send an unequivocal message to lawyers advising
clients in this

space: It is not just your clients who might suffer if the content
industry directs its guns against them. It is also you. So those of

<para>
This strategy is not just limited to the lawyers. In April 2003,
Universal and EMI brought a lawsuit against Hummer Winblad, the
venture capital firm (VC) that had funded Napster at a certain stage of
its development, its cofounder (John Hummer), and general partner
(Hank Barry).<footnote><para>

The claim here, as well, was that the VC should have recognized the
right of the content industry to control how the industry should
develop. They should be held personally liable for funding a company
whose business turned out to be beyond the law. Here again, the aim of
the lawsuit is transparent: Any VC now recognizes that if you fund a
company whose business is not approved of by the dinosaurs, you are at
risk not just in the marketplace, but in the courtroom as well.  Your
investment buys you not only a company, it also buys you a lawsuit.

The point is not that businesses should have a right to start illegal
enterprises. The point is the definition of <quote>illegal.</quote> The law is a
mess of uncertainty. We have no good way to know how it should apply
to new technologies. Yet by reversing our tradition of judicial
deference, and by embracing the astonishingly high penalties that
copyright law imposes, that uncertainty now yields a reality which is
far more conservative than is right. If the law imposed the death
penalty for parking tickets, we'd not only have fewer parking tickets,
we'd also have much less driving. The same principle applies to
innovation. If innovation is constantly checked by this uncertain and
unlimited liability, we will have much less vibrant innovation and
much less creativity.
</para>
<para>
The point is directly parallel to the crunchy-lefty point about fair
use. Whatever the <quote>real</quote> law is, realism about the effect of law in
both contexts is the same. This wildly punitive system of regulation
will systematically stifle creativity and innovation. It will protect
some industries and some creators, but it will harm industry and
creativity generally. Free market and free culture depend upon vibrant
competition.  Yet the effect of the law today is to stifle just this
kind of competition.  The effect is to produce an overregulated
culture, just as the effect of too much control in the market is to
produce an overregulated-regulated market.
</para>
<para>
The building of a permission culture, rather than a free culture, is
the first important way in which the changes I have described will
burden innovation. A permission culture means a lawyer's
culture&mdash;a culture in which the ability to create requires a call
to your lawyer. Again, I am not antilawyer, at least when they're kept
in their proper place. I am certainly not antilaw. But our profession
has lost the sense of its limits. And leaders in our profession have
lost an appreciation of the high costs that our profession imposes
upon others. The inefficiency of the law is an embarrassment to our
tradition. And while I believe our profession should therefore do
everything it can to make the law more efficient, it should at least
do everything it can to limit the reach of the
<!-- PAGE BREAK 202 -->
law where the law is not doing any good. The transaction costs buried
within a permission culture are enough to bury a wide range of
creativity.  Someone needs to do a lot of justifying to justify that
result.

overall this history of copyright is not bad. As chapter

when new technologies have come along, Congress has struck a balance

But that pattern of deference to new technologies has now changed

copyright holders from liability for damage done to computers when the

that technologies capable of rebroadcasting digital copies of films

As I described in chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="pirates"/>, when a radio station plays a song, the recording
artist doesn't get paid for that <quote>radio performance</quote> unless he or she
is also the composer. So, for example if Marilyn Monroe had recorded a
version of <quote>Happy Birthday</quote>&mdash;to memorialize her famous
performance before President Kennedy at Madison Square Garden&mdash;
then whenever that recording was played on the radio, the current
copyright owners of <quote>Happy Birthday</quote> would get some money, whereas
Marilyn Monroe would not.
</para>
<para>
The reasoning behind this balance struck by Congress makes some
sense. The justification was that radio was a kind of advertising. The
recording artist thus benefited because by playing her music, the
radio station was making it more likely that her records would be
purchased.  Thus, the recording artist got something, even if only
indirectly.  Probably this reasoning had less to do with the result
than with the power of radio stations: Their lobbyists were quite good
at stopping any efforts to get Congress to require compensation to the
recording artists.

Enter Internet radio. Like regular radio, Internet radio is a
technology to stream content from a broadcaster to a listener. The
broadcast travels across the Internet, not across the ether of radio
spectrum.  Thus, I can <quote>tune in</quote> to an Internet radio station in
Berlin while sitting in San Francisco, even though there's no way for
me to tune in to a regular radio station much beyond the San Francisco
metropolitan area.

<para>
This feature of the architecture of Internet radio means that there
are potentially an unlimited number of radio stations that a user
could tune in to using her computer, whereas under the existing
architecture for broadcast radio, there is an obvious limit to the
number of broadcasters and clear broadcast frequencies. Internet radio
could therefore be more competitive than regular radio; it could
provide a wider range of selections. And because the potential
audience for Internet radio is the whole world, niche stations could
easily develop and market their content to a relatively large number
of users worldwide. According to some estimates, more than eighty
million users worldwide have tuned in to this new form of radio.

Internet radio is thus to radio what FM was to AM. It is an
improvement potentially vastly more significant than the FM
improvement over AM, since not only is the technology better, so, too,
is the competition. Indeed, there is a direct parallel between the
fight to establish FM radio and the fight to protect Internet
radio. As one author describes Howard Armstrong's struggle to enable
FM radio,
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
An almost unlimited number of FM stations was possible in the
shortwaves, thus ending the unnatural restrictions imposed on radio in
the crowded longwaves. If FM were freely developed, the number of
stations would be limited only by economics and competition rather
than by technical restrictions. &hellip; Armstrong likened the situation
that had grown up in radio to that following the invention of the
printing press, when governments and ruling interests attempted to
control this new instrument of mass communications by imposing
restrictive licenses on it. This tyranny was broken only when it
became possible for men freely to acquire printing presses and freely
to run them. FM in this sense was as great an invention as the
printing presses, for it gave radio the opportunity to strike off its
shackles.<footnote><para>
<!-- f12. -->
Lessing, 239.
</para></footnote>
</para>
</blockquote>
<para>
This potential for FM radio was never realized&mdash;not
because Armstrong was wrong about the technology, but because he
underestimated the power of <quote>vested interests, habits, customs and
legislation</quote><footnote><para>
<!-- f13. -->
Ibid., 229.
</para></footnote>
to retard the growth of this competing technology.
</para>
<para>
Now the very same claim could be made about Internet radio. For
again, there is no technical limitation that could restrict the number of
Internet radio stations. The only restrictions on Internet radio are
those imposed by the law. Copyright law is one such law. So the first
question we should ask is, what copyright rules would govern Internet
radio?

But here the power of the lobbyists is reversed. Internet radio is a
new industry. The recording artists, on the other hand, have a very

<!-- PAGE BREAK 206 -->
powerful lobby, the RIAA. Thus when Congress considered the phenomenon
of Internet radio in 1995, the lobbyists had primed Congress to adopt
a different rule for Internet radio than the rule that applies to
terrestrial radio. While terrestrial radio does not have to pay our
hypothetical Marilyn Monroe when it plays her hypothetical recording
of <quote>Happy Birthday</quote> on the air, <emphasis>Internet radio
does</emphasis>. Not only is the law not neutral toward Internet
radio&mdash;the law actually burdens Internet radio more than it
burdens terrestrial radio.
</para>
<para>
This financial burden is not slight. As Harvard law professor
William Fisher estimates, if an Internet radio station distributed adfree
popular music to (on average) ten thousand listeners, twenty-four
hours a day, the total artist fees that radio station would owe would be
over $1 million a year.<footnote>
<para>
<!-- f14. -->
This example was derived from fees set by the original Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) proceedings, and is drawn from an
example offered by Professor William Fisher. Conference Proceedings,
iLaw (Stanford), 3 July 2003, on file with author. Professors Fisher
and Zittrain submitted testimony in the CARP proceeding that was
ultimately rejected.  See Jonathan Zittrain, Digital Performance Right

Distribution,</quote> <citetitle>Antitrust Bulletin</citetitle> (Summer/Fall 2002): 461: <quote>This was
not confusion, these are just old-fashioned entry barriers. Analog
radio stations are protected from digital entrants, reducing entry in

webcasters asked the RIAA, &hellip; <quote>How  do  you  come  up  with a

rate that's so much higher? Why is it worth more than radio?  Because

The war that is being waged today is a war of prohibition. As with
every war of prohibition, it is targeted against the behavior of a very
large number of citizens. According to <citetitle>The New York Times</citetitle>, 43 million
Americans downloaded music in May 2002.<footnote><para>

The Pew Internet and American Life Project reported that 37 million
Americans had downloaded music files from the Internet by early 2001.
</para></footnote>
 According to the RIAA,
the behavior of those 43 million Americans is a felony. We thus have a
set of rules that transform 20 percent of America into criminals. As the

<!-- PAGE BREAK 209 -->
RIAA launches lawsuits against not only the Napsters and Kazaas of
the world, but against students building search engines, and 
		increasingly
against ordinary users downloading content, the technologies for
sharing will advance to further protect and hide illegal use. It is an arms
race or a civil war, with the extremes of one side inviting a more 
		extreme
response by the other.
</para>
<para>
The content industry's tactics exploit the failings of the American
legal system. When the RIAA brought suit against Jesse Jordan, it
knew that in Jordan it had found a scapegoat, not a defendant. The
threat of having to pay either all the money in the world in damages
($15,000,000) or almost all the money in the world to defend against
paying all the money in the world in damages ($250,000 in legal fees)
led Jordan to choose to pay all the money he had in the world
($12,000) to make the suit go away. The same strategy animates the
RIAA's suits against individual users. In September 2003, the RIAA
sued 261 individuals&mdash;including a twelve-year-old girl living in public
housing and a seventy-year-old man who had no idea what file sharing
was.<footnote><para>
<!-- f16. -->
Alex Pham, <quote>The Labels Strike Back: N.Y. Girl Settles RIAA Case,</quote> <citetitle>Los
Angeles Times</citetitle>, 10 September 2003, Business.
</para></footnote>
As these scapegoats discovered, it will always cost more to defend
against these suits than it would cost to simply settle. (The twelve
year old, for example, like Jesse Jordan, paid her life savings of $2,000
to settle the case.) Our law is an awful system for defending rights. It
is an embarrassment to our tradition. And the consequence of our law
as it is, is that those with the power can use the law to quash any rights
they oppose.

Wars of prohibition are nothing new in America. This one is just
something more extreme than anything we've seen before. We
experimented with alcohol prohibition, at a time when the per capita
consumption of alcohol was 1.5 gallons per capita per year. The war
against drinking initially reduced that consumption to just 30 percent
of its preprohibition levels, but by the end of prohibition,
consumption was up to 70 percent of the preprohibition
level. Americans were drinking just about as much, but now, a vast
number were criminals.<footnote><para>

This state of affairs is not without consequence. It is a particularly

students about the importance of <quote>ethics.</quote> As my colleague Charlie
Nesson told a class at Stanford, each year law schools admit thousands
of students who have illegally downloaded music, illegally consumed
alcohol and sometimes drugs, illegally worked without paying taxes,
illegally driven cars. These are kids for whom behaving illegally is
increasingly the norm. And then we, as law professors, are supposed to
teach them how to behave ethically&mdash;how to say no to bribes, or
keep client funds separate, or honor a demand to disclose a document
that will mean that your case is over. Generations of
Americans&mdash;more significantly in some parts of America than in
others, but still, everywhere in America today&mdash;can't live their
lives both normally and legally, since <quote>normally</quote> entails a certain
degree of illegality.
</para>
<para>
The response to this general illegality is either to enforce the law
more severely or to change the law. We, as a society, have to learn
how to make that choice more rationally. Whether a law makes sense
depends, in part, at least, upon whether the costs of the law, both
intended and collateral, outweigh the benefits. If the costs, intended
and collateral, do outweigh the benefits, then the law ought to be
changed.  Alternatively, if the costs of the existing system are much
greater than the costs of an alternative, then we have a good reason
to consider the alternative.

My point is not the idiotic one: Just because people violate a law, we
should therefore repeal it. Obviously, we could reduce murder statistics
dramatically by legalizing murder on Wednesdays and Fridays. But
that wouldn't make any sense, since murder is wrong every day of the
week. A society is right to ban murder always and everywhere.
</para>
<para>
My point is instead one that democracies understood for generations,
but that we recently have learned to forget. The rule of law depends
upon people obeying the law. The more often, and more repeatedly, we
as citizens experience violating the law, the less we respect the
law. Obviously, in most cases, the important issue is the law, not
respect for the law. I don't care whether the rapist respects the law
or not; I want to catch and incarcerate the rapist. But I do care
whether my students respect the law. And I do care if the rules of law
sow increasing disrespect because of the extreme of regulation they
impose.  Twenty million Americans have come of age since the Internet
introduced this different idea of <quote>sharing.</quote> We need to be able to
call these twenty million Americans <quote>citizens,</quote> not <quote>felons.</quote>
</para>
<para>
When at least forty-three million citizens download content from the
Internet, and when they use tools to combine that content in ways
unauthorized by copyright holders, the first question we should be
asking is not how best to involve the FBI. The first question should
be whether this particular prohibition is really necessary in order to
achieve the proper ends that copyright law serves. Is there another
way to assure that artists get paid without transforming forty-three
million Americans into felons? Does it make sense if there are other
ways to assure that artists get paid without transforming America into
a nation of felons?
</para>
<para>
This abstract point can be made more clear with a particular example.
</para>
<para>
We all own CDs. Many of us still own phonograph records. These pieces
of plastic encode music that in a certain sense we have bought.  The
law protects our right to buy and sell that plastic: It is not a

record store and buy jazz records to replace them. That <quote>use</quote> of the
recordings is free.
</para>
<para>
But as the MP3 craze has demonstrated, there is another use of
phonograph records that is effectively free. Because these recordings
were made without copy-protection technologies, I am <quote>free</quote> to copy,
or <quote>rip,</quote> music from my records onto a computer hard disk. Indeed,
Apple Corporation went so far as to suggest that <quote>freedom</quote> was a
right: In a series of commercials, Apple endorsed the <quote>Rip, Mix, Burn</quote>
capacities of digital technologies.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Andromeda</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm id='idxcdsmix' class='startofrange'><primary>CDs</primary><secondary>mix technology and</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
This <quote>use</quote> of my records is certainly valuable. I have begun a large
process at home of ripping all of my and my wife's CDs, and storing
them in one archive. Then, using Apple's iTunes, or a wonderful
program called Andromeda, we can build different play lists of our
music: Bach, Baroque, Love Songs, Love Songs of Significant
Others&mdash;the potential is endless. And by reducing the costs of
mixing play lists, these technologies help build a creativity with
play lists that is itself independently valuable. Compilations of
songs are creative and meaningful in their own right.
</para>
<para>
This use is enabled by unprotected media&mdash;either CDs or records.
But unprotected media also enable file sharing. File sharing threatens
(or so the content industry believes) the ability of creators to earn
a fair return from their creativity. And thus, many are beginning to
experiment with technologies to eliminate unprotected media. These
technologies, for example, would enable CDs that could not be
ripped. Or they might enable spy programs to identify ripped content
on people's machines.
</para>
<para>
If these technologies took off, then the building of large archives of
your own music would become quite difficult. You might hang in hacker
circles, and get technology to disable the technologies that protect
the content. Trading in those technologies is illegal, but maybe that
doesn't bother you much. In any case, for the vast majority of people,
these protection technologies would effectively destroy the archiving

<!-- PAGE BREAK 213 -->
use of CDs. The technology, in other words, would force us all back to
the world where we either listened to music by manipulating pieces of
plastic or were part of a massively complex <quote>digital rights
management</quote> system.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxcdsmix' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
If the only way to assure that artists get paid were the elimination
of the ability to freely move content, then these technologies to
interfere with the freedom to move content would be justifiable. But
what if there were another way to assure that artists are paid,
without locking down any content? What if, in other words, a different
system could assure compensation to artists while also preserving the
freedom to move content easily?
</para>
<para>
My point just now is not to prove that there is such a system. I offer
a version of such a system in the last chapter of this book. For now,
the only point is the relatively uncontroversial one: If a different
system achieved the same legitimate objectives that the existing
copyright system achieved, but left consumers and creators much more
free, then we'd have a very good reason to pursue this
alternative&mdash;namely, freedom.  The choice, in other words, would
not be between property and piracy; the choice would be between
different property systems and the freedoms each allowed.
</para>
<para>
I believe there is a way to assure that artists are paid without
turning forty-three million Americans into felons. But the salient
feature of this alternative is that it would lead to a very different
market for producing and distributing creativity. The dominant few,
who today control the vast majority of the distribution of content in
the world, would no longer exercise this extreme of control. Rather,
they would go the way of the horse-drawn buggy.
</para>
<para>
Except that this generation's buggy manufacturers have already saddled
Congress, and are riding the law to protect themselves against this
new form of competition. For them the choice is between fortythree
million Americans as criminals and their own survival.
</para>
<para>
It is understandable why they choose as they do. It is not
understandable why we as a democracy continue to choose as we do. Jack

<emphasis role='strong'>There's one more</emphasis> aspect to this
corruption that is particularly important to civil liberties, and
follows directly from any war of prohibition.  As Electronic Frontier

<quote>collateral damage</quote> that <quote>arises whenever you turn
a very large percentage of the population into criminals.</quote> This
is the collateral damage to civil liberties generally.

<quote>If you can treat someone as a putative lawbreaker,</quote> von Lohmann
explains,
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
then all of a sudden a lot of basic civil liberty protections
evaporate to one degree or another. &hellip; If you're a copyright
infringer, how can you hope to have any privacy rights? If you're a

against file sharing has done is turn a remarkable percentage of the
American Internet-using population into <quote>lawbreakers.</quote>

<para>
And the consequence of this transformation of the American public
into criminals is that it becomes trivial, as a matter of due process, to
effectively erase much of the privacy most would presume.

Users of the Internet began to see this generally in 2003 as the RIAA
launched its campaign to force Internet service providers to turn over
the names of customers who the RIAA believed were violating copyright
law. Verizon fought that demand and lost. With a simple request to a
judge, and without any notice to the customer at all, the identity of
an Internet user is revealed.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 215 -->
The RIAA then expanded this campaign, by announcing a general strategy
to sue individual users of the Internet who are alleged to have
downloaded copyrighted music from file-sharing systems. But as we've
seen, the potential damages from these suits are astronomical: If a
family's computer is used to download a single CD's worth of music,
the family could be liable for $2 million in damages. That didn't stop
the RIAA from suing a number of these families, just as they had sued
Jesse Jordan.<footnote><para>

So when we're talking about numbers like forty to sixty million
Americans that are essentially copyright infringers, you create a

peril in a general matter. [I don't] think [there is any] analog where
you could randomly choose any person off the street and be confident
that they were committing an unlawful act that could put them on the
hook for potential felony liability or hundreds of millions of dollars
of civil liability. Certainly we all speed, but speeding isn't the
kind of an act for which we routinely forfeit civil liberties. Some
people use drugs, and I think that's the closest analog, [but] many
have noted that the war against drugs has eroded all of our civil
liberties because it's treated so many Americans as criminals. Well, I
think it's fair to say that file sharing is an order of magnitude
larger number of Americans than drug use. &hellip; If forty to sixty

slippery slope to lose a lot of civil liberties for all forty to sixty

Eldred thought, with links to pictures and explanatory text, would
make this nineteenth-century author's work come alive.

It didn't work&mdash;at least for his daughters. They didn't find

Eldred's library was not simply a copy of certain public domain
works, though even a copy would have been of great value to people
across the world who can't get access to printed versions of these
works. Instead, Eldred was producing derivative works from these
public domain works. Just as Disney turned Grimm into stories more

many others, into a form more accessible&mdash;technically

Eldred's freedom to do this with Hawthorne's work grew from the same
source as Disney's. Hawthorne's <citetitle>Scarlet Letter</citetitle> had passed into the
public domain in 1907. It was free for anyone to take without the
permission of the Hawthorne estate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover
Press and Penguin Classics, take works from the public domain and
produce printed editions, which they sell in bookstores across the
country. Others, such as Disney, take these stories and turn them into
animated cartoons, sometimes successfully (<citetitle>Cinderella</citetitle>), sometimes not
(<citetitle>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</citetitle>, <citetitle>Treasure Planet</citetitle>). These are all
commercial publications of public domain works.

The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications of
public domain works. Eldred's is just one example. There are literally
thousands of others. Hundreds of thousands from across the world have
discovered this platform of expression and now use it to share works
that are, by law, free for the taking. This has produced what we might
call the <quote>noncommercial publishing industry,</quote> which before the
Internet was limited to people with large egos or with political or
social causes. But with the Internet, it includes a wide range of
individuals and groups dedicated to spreading culture
generally.<footnote><para>

There's a parallel here with pornography that is a bit hard to
describe, but it's a strong one. One phenomenon that the Internet
created was a world of noncommercial pornographers&mdash;people who
were distributing porn but were not making money directly or
indirectly from that distribution.  Such a class didn't exist before
the Internet came into being because the costs of distributing porn
were so high. Yet this new class of distributors got special attention
in the Supreme Court, when the Court struck down the Communications
Decency Act of 1996. It was partly because of the burden on
noncommercial speakers that the statute was found to exceed Congress's
power. The same point could have been made about noncommercial
publishers after the advent of the Internet. The Eric Eldreds of the
world before the Internet were extremely few. Yet one would think it
at least as important to protect the Eldreds of the world as to
protect noncommercial pornographers.</para></footnote>

As I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost's
collection of poems <citetitle>New Hampshire</citetitle> was slated to

his free public library.  But Congress got in the way. As I described
in chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="property-i"/>, in 1998, for the eleventh time in forty years,
Congress extended the terms of existing copyrights&mdash;this time by
twenty years. Eldred would not be free to add any works more recent
than 1923 to his collection until 2019.  Indeed, no copyrighted work
would pass into the public domain until that year (and not even then,
if Congress extends the term again). By contrast, in the same period,
more than 1 million patents will pass into the public domain.

As an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember
sitting late at the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious
consideration of the question. No one had ever challenged Congress's
practice of extending existing terms. That failure may in part be why
Congress seemed so untroubled in its habit. That, and the fact that
the practice had become so lucrative for Congress. Congress knows that
copyright owners will be willing to pay a great deal of money to see
their copyright terms extended. And so Congress is quite happy to keep
this gravy train going.

beneficiaries of Congress's acts to raise and give money to Congress
to induce it to act. There's only so much time; there's only so much
Congress can do. Why not limit its actions to those things it must
do&mdash;and those things that pay? Extending copyright terms pays.
</para>
<para>
If that's not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you're one
of the very few lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to
make money one hundred years after it was created. The Estate of
Robert Frost is a good example. Frost died in 1963. His poetry
continues to be extraordinarily valuable. Thus the Robert Frost estate
benefits greatly from any extension of copyright, since no publisher
would pay the estate any money if the poems Frost wrote could be
published by anyone for free.
</para>
<para>
So imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from
three of Frost's poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems
is about to expire. You sit on the board of the Robert Frost estate.
Your financial adviser comes to your board meeting with a very grim
report:
</para>
<para>
<quote>Next year,</quote> the adviser announces, <quote>our copyrights in works A, B,

<!-- PAGE BREAK 224 -->
and C will expire. That means that after next year, we will no longer be
receiving the annual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers of
those works.</quote>
</para>
<para>
<quote>There's a proposal in Congress, however,</quote> she continues, <quote>that
could change this. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the
terms of copyright by twenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily
valuable to us. So we should hope this bill passes.</quote>
</para>
<para>
<quote>Hope?</quote> a fellow board member says. <quote>Can't we be doing something
about it?</quote>
</para>
<para>
<quote>Well, obviously, yes,</quote> the adviser responds. <quote>We could contribute
to the campaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that
they support the bill.</quote>
</para>
<para>
You hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want
to know whether this disgusting practice is worth it. <quote>How much
would we get if this extension were passed?</quote> you ask the adviser. <quote>How
much is it worth?</quote>
</para>
<para>
<quote>Well,</quote> the adviser says, <quote>if you're confident that you will continue
to get at least $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the
<quote>discount rate</quote> that we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent),
then this law would be worth $1,146,000 to the estate.</quote>
</para>
<para>
You're a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the
correct conclusion:
</para>
<para>
<quote>So you're saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than
$1,000,000 in campaign contributions if we were confident those 
		contributions
would assure that the bill was passed?</quote>
</para>
<para>
<quote>Absolutely,</quote> the adviser responds. <quote>It is worth it to you to 
		contribute
up to the <quote>present value</quote> of the income you expect from these
copyrights. Which for us means over $1,000,000.</quote>
</para>
<para>
You quickly get the point&mdash;you as the member of the board and, I
trust, you the reader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every
beneficiary in the position of the Robert Frost estate faces the same
choice: If they can contribute to get a law passed to extend copyrights,
<!-- PAGE BREAK 225 -->
they will benefit greatly from that extension. And so each time
	copyrights
are about to expire, there is a massive amount of lobbying to get
the copyright term extended.
</para>
<para>
Thus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legislation
can be bought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in
the world to buy further extensions of copyright.

<emphasis role='strong'>Constitutional law</emphasis> is not oblivious
to the obvious. Or at least, it need not be. So when I was considering
Eldred's complaint, this reality about the never-ending incentives to
increase the copyright term was central to my thinking. In my view, a
pragmatic court committed to interpreting and applying the
Constitution of our framers would see that if Congress has the power
to extend existing terms, then there would be no effective
constitutional requirement that terms be <quote>limited.</quote> If
they could extend it once, they would extend it again and again and

It was also my judgment that <emphasis>this</emphasis> Supreme Court
would not allow Congress to extend existing terms. As anyone close to
the Supreme Court's work knows, this Court has increasingly restricted
the power of Congress when it has viewed Congress's actions as
exceeding the power granted to it by the Constitution. Among
constitutional scholars, the most famous example of this trend was the
Supreme Court's

Since 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress's granted

include the power to regulate any activity that merely affected

As the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there was

The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist's command, changed
that in <citetitle>United States</citetitle> v. <citetitle>Lopez</citetitle>. The government had
argued that possessing guns near schools affected interstate
commerce. Guns near schools increase crime, crime lowers property
values, and so on. In the oral argument, the Chief Justice asked the
government whether there was any activity that would not affect
interstate commerce under the reasoning the government advanced. The
government said there was not; if Congress says an activity affects
interstate commerce, then that activity affects interstate
commerce. The Supreme Court, the government said, was not in the

And if it is applied to the Progress Clause, the principle should

term, then there would be no <quote>stopping point</quote> to Congress's power over
terms, though the Constitution expressly states that there is such a

piracy&mdash;piracy of the public domain. When Robert Frost wrote his
work and when Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright
term was just fifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and
Disney had already enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their
work. They had gotten the benefit of the bargain that the Constitution
envisions: In exchange for a monopoly protected for fifty-six years,
they created new work. But now these entities were using their
power&mdash;expressed through the power of lobbyists' money&mdash;to
get another twenty-year dollop of monopoly. That twenty-year dollop
would be taken from the public domain. Eric Eldred was fighting a
piracy that affects us all.

As we've seen, our constitutional system requires limits on

Eldred discovered, we have set up a system that assures that copyright
terms will be repeatedly extended, and extended, and extended. We

not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to be

Forget Mickey Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. Forget all the works from

But the law and its effect were not limited to that 2 percent. The law

<indexterm><primary>archives, digital</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Well, first, you'd have to determine which of the 9,873 books were
still under copyright. That requires going to a library (these data are
not on-line) and paging through tomes of books, cross-checking the
titles and authors of the 9,873 books with the copyright registration
and renewal records for works published in 1930. That will produce a
list of books still under copyright.
</para>
<para>
Then for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate
the current copyright owners. How would you do that?
</para>
<para>
Most people think that there must be a list of these copyright 
		owners
somewhere. Practical people think this way. How could there be
thousands and thousands of government monopolies without there
being at least a list?
</para>
<para>
But there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in
1959, of the person who registered the copyright. But just think 
		practically
about how impossibly difficult it would be to track down 
		thousands
of such records&mdash;especially since the person who registered is
not necessarily the current owner. And we're just talking about 1930!
</para>
<para>
<quote>But there isn't a list of who owns property generally,</quote> the
apologists for the system respond. <quote>Why should there be a list of
copyright owners?</quote>
</para>
<para>
Well, actually, if you think about it, there <emphasis>are</emphasis>
plenty of lists of who owns what property. Think about deeds on
houses, or titles to cars.  And where there isn't a list, the code of
real space is pretty good at suggesting who the owner of a bit of
property is. (A swing set in your backyard is probably yours.) So
formally or informally, we have a pretty good way to know who owns
what tangible property.
</para>
<para>
So: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who
owns the house by looking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see
a car, there is ordinarily a license plate that will link the owner to the

<!-- PAGE BREAK 230 -->
car. If you see a bunch of children's toys sitting on the front lawn of a
house, it's fairly easy to determine who owns the toys. And if you 
		happen
to see a baseball lying in a gutter on the side of the road, look
around for a second for some kids playing ball. If you don't see any
kids, then okay: Here's a bit of property whose owner we can't easily
determine. It is the exception that proves the rule: that we ordinarily
know quite well who owns what property.
</para>
<para>
Compare this story to intangible property. You go into a library.
The library owns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I've 
		already
described, there's no list of copyright owners. There are authors'
names, of course, but their copyrights could have been assigned, or
passed down in an estate like Grandma's old jewelry. To know who
owns what, you would have to hire a private detective. The bottom
line: The owner cannot easily be located. And in a regime like ours, in
which it is a felony to use such property without the property owner's
permission, the property isn't going to be used.
</para>
<para>
The consequence with respect to old books is that they won't be
digitized, and hence will simply rot away on shelves. But the

currently out of copyright. But for the CTEA, films made after 1923
would have begun entering the public domain. Because Agee controls the
exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great deal of
money. According to one estimate, <quote>Roach has sold about 60,000

Yet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare virtue in
this culture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the Supreme

</para>
<para>
His argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has

any continuing commercial value. The rest&mdash;to the extent it
survives at all&mdash;sits in vaults gathering dust. It may be that
some of this work not now commercially valuable will be deemed to be
valuable by the owners of the vaults. For this to occur, however, the
commercial benefit from the work must exceed the costs of making the
work available for distribution.
</para>
<para>
We can't know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs.
For most of the history of film, the costs of restoring film were very
high; digital technology has lowered these costs substantially. While
it cost more than $10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white
film in 1993, it can now cost as little as $100 to digitize one hour of
8 mm film.<footnote><para>

</para></footnote>

</para>
<para>
Restoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most 
		important.
Lawyers, too, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In
addition to preserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the rights.
And to secure the rights for a film that is under copyright, you need to
locate the copyright owner.
</para>
<para>
Or more accurately, <emphasis>owners</emphasis>. As we've seen, there
isn't only a single copyright associated with a film; there are
many. There isn't a single person whom you can contact about those
copyrights; there are as many as can hold the rights, which turns out
to be an extremely large number. Thus the costs of clearing the rights
to these films is exceptionally high.
</para>
<para>
<quote>But can't you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the
copyright owner when she shows up?</quote> Sure, if you want to commit a
felony. And even if you're not worried about committing a felony, when
she does show up, she'll have the right to sue you for all the profits you
have made. So, if you're successful, you can be fairly confident you'll be
getting a call from someone's lawyer. And if you're not successful, you
won't make enough to cover the costs of your own lawyer. Either way,
you have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too often the case, saying you have
to talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you won't make any money.
</para>
<para>
For some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed

<!-- PAGE BREAK 232 -->
these costs. But for the vast majority of them, there is no way the 
		benefit
would outweigh the legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of old
films, Agee argued, the film will not be restored and distributed until
the copyright expires.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxageemichael' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
But by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will
have expired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and
nitrate stock dissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal 
		canisters
in which they are now stored will be filled with nothing more
than dust.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role='strong'>Of all the</emphasis> creative work produced
by humans anywhere, a tiny fraction has continuing commercial
value. For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a crucially important
legal device. For that tiny fraction, the copyright creates incentives
to produce and distribute the creative work. For that tiny fraction,
the copyright acts as an <quote>engine of free expression.</quote>
</para>
<para>
But even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the
creative work has a commercial life is extremely short. As I've 
		indicated,
most books go out of print within one year. The same is true of
music and film. Commercial culture is sharklike. It must keep moving.
And when a creative work falls out of favor with the commercial 
		distributors,
the commercial life ends.
</para>
<para>
Yet that doesn't mean the life of the creative work ends. We don't
keep libraries of books in order to compete with Barnes &amp; Noble, and
we don't have archives of films because we expect people to choose 
		between
spending Friday night watching new movies and spending 
		Friday
night watching a 1930 news documentary. The noncommercial life
of culture is important and valuable&mdash;for entertainment but also, and
more importantly, for knowledge. To understand who we are, and
where we came from, and how we have made the mistakes that we
have, we need to have access to this history.
</para>
<para>
Copyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression.

<!-- PAGE BREAK 233 -->
In this context, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in
this context do no good.
</para>
<para>
Yet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of
our history, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no
<emphasis>copyright-related use</emphasis> that would be inhibited by
an exclusive right.  When a book went out of print, you could not buy
it from a publisher.  But you could still buy it from a used book
store, and when a used book store sells it, in America, at least,
there is no need to pay the copyright owner anything. Thus, the
ordinary use of a book after its commercial life ended was a use that
was independent of copyright law.
</para>
<para>
The same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring
a film&mdash;the real economic costs, not the lawyer costs&mdash;were
so high, it was never at all feasible to preserve or restore
film. Like the remains of a great dinner, when it's over, it's
over. Once a film passed out of its commercial life, it may have been
archived for a bit, but that was the end of its life so long as the
market didn't have more to offer.
</para>
<para>
In other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most
of our history, long copyrights wouldn't have mattered for the works
that lost their commercial value. Long copyrights for these works
would not have interfered with anything.
</para>
<para>
But this situation has now changed.

<para>
One crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital
technologies is to enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of.
Digital technologies now make it possible to preserve and give access
to all sorts of knowledge. Once a book goes out of print, we can now
imagine digitizing it and making it available to everyone,
forever. Once a film goes out of distribution, we could digitize it
and make it available to everyone, forever. Digital technologies give
new life to copyrighted material after it passes out of its commercial
life. It is now possible to preserve and assure universal access to
this knowledge and culture, whereas before it was not.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 234 -->
And now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of producing
this digital archive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right
of copyright. To digitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires
permission of the copyright owner. The same with music, film, or any
other aspect of our culture protected by copyright. The effort to make
these things available to history, or to researchers, or to those who
just want to explore, is now inhibited by a set of rules that were
written for a radically different context.
</para>

Here is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms: Now that
technology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria, the law
gets in the way. And it doesn't get in the way for any useful
<emphasis>copyright</emphasis> purpose, for the purpose of copyright
is to enable the commercial market that spreads culture. No, we are
talking about culture after it has lived its commercial life. In this
context, copyright is serving no purpose <emphasis>at all</emphasis>
related to the spread of knowledge. In this context, copyright is not
an engine of free expression. Copyright is a brake.

Maybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that
publishers would be as complete as libraries. If Barnes &amp; Noble
offered to lend books from its stores for a low price, would that
eliminate the need for libraries? Only if you think that the only role
of a library is to serve what <quote>the market</quote> would demand. But if you
think the role of a library is bigger than this&mdash;if you think its
role is to archive culture, whether there's a demand for any
particular bit of that culture or not&mdash;then we can't count on the
commercial market to do our library work for us.

I would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We
should rely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable
culture. My message is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the
market is not doing the job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the

freedom to fill the gaps. As one researcher calculated for American
culture, 94 percent of the films, books, and music produced between
1923 and 1946 is not commercially available. However much you love the
commercial market, if access is a value, then 6 percent is a failure
to provide that value.<footnote><para>

<emphasis role='strong'>In January 1999</emphasis>, we filed a lawsuit
on Eric Eldred's behalf in federal district court in Washington, D.C.,
asking the court to declare the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension
Act unconstitutional. The two central claims that we made were (1)
that extending existing terms violated the Constitution's
<quote>limited Times</quote> requirement, and (2) that extending terms
by another twenty years violated the First Amendment.
</para>
<para>
The district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an
argument.  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also
dismissed our claims, though after hearing an extensive argument. But
that decision at least had a dissent, by one of the most conservative
judges on that court. That dissent gave our claims life.
</para>
<para>
Judge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that
copyrights be for <quote>limited Times</quote> only. His argument was as elegant as
it was simple: If Congress can extend existing terms, then there is no
<quote>stopping point</quote> to Congress's power under the Copyright Clause. The
power to extend existing terms means Congress is not required to grant
terms that are <quote>limited.</quote> Thus, Judge Sentelle argued, the court had
to interpret the term <quote>limited Times</quote> to give it meaning. And the best
interpretation, Judge Sentelle argued, would be to deny Congress the
power to extend existing terms.
</para>
<para>
We asked the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a whole to
hear the case. Cases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for
important cases or cases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a
whole, where the court will sit <quote>en banc</quote> to hear the case.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Tatel, David</primary></indexterm>
<para>
The Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc.
This time, Judge Sentelle was joined by the most liberal member of the

<!-- PAGE BREAK 236 -->
D.C. Circuit, Judge David Tatel. Both the most conservative and the
most liberal judges in the D.C. Circuit believed Congress had
overstepped its bounds.
</para>
<para>
It was here that most expected <citetitle>Eldred</citetitle>
v. <citetitle>Ashcroft</citetitle> would die, for the Supreme Court
rarely reviews any decision by a court of appeals. (It hears about one
hundred cases a year, out of more than five thousand appeals.) And it
practically never reviews a decision that upholds a statute when no
other court has yet reviewed the statute.
</para>
<para>
But in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by
granting our petition to review the D.C. Circuit opinion. Argument
was set for October of 2002. The summer would be spent writing
briefs and preparing for argument.

literally thousands of missives by well-wishers and supporters,
thanking me for my work on behalf of this noble but doomed cause. And
none from this pile was more significant to me than the e-mail from my

it became obvious only at the very end. Our case had been supported
from the very beginning by an extraordinary lawyer, Geoffrey Stewart,
and by the law firm he had moved to, Jones, Day, Reavis and

<para>
There were three key lawyers on the case from Jones Day. Geoff
Stewart was the first, but then Dan Bromberg and Don Ayer became
quite involved. Bromberg and Ayer in particular had a common view
about how this case would be won: We would only win, they repeatedly
told me, if we could make the issue seem <quote>important</quote> to the Supreme
Court. It had to seem as if dramatic harm were being done to free
speech and free culture; otherwise, they would never vote against <quote>the
most powerful media companies in the world.</quote>
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxjonesdayreavisandpoguejonesday' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
I hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act
was a dramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still
think it is. But the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based
on how important they believe the issues are is just wrong. It might be
<quote>right</quote> as in <quote>true,</quote> I thought, but it is <quote>wrong</quote> as in <quote>it just shouldn't be
that way.</quote> As I believed that any faithful interpretation of what the
framers of our Constitution did would yield the conclusion that the
CTEA was unconstitutional, and as I believed that any faithful 
		interpretation
of what the First Amendment means would yield the
conclusion that the power to extend existing copyright terms is 
		unconstitutional,
I was not persuaded that we had to sell our case like soap.
Just as a law that bans the swastika is unconstitutional not because the
Court likes Nazis but because such a law would violate the 
		Constitution,
so too, in my view, would the Court decide whether Congress's
law was constitutional based on the Constitution, not based on whether
they liked the values that the framers put in the Constitution.
</para>
<para>
In any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and
the harm caused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review?
There was no reason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they
weren't convinced that this regulation was harmful. So in my view, we
didn't need to persuade them that this law was bad, we needed to show
why it was unconstitutional.
</para>
<para>
There was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter

<!-- PAGE BREAK 238 -->
and in which I thought a response was appropriate. I was convinced
that the Court would not hear our arguments if it thought these were
just the arguments of a group of lefty loons. This Supreme Court was
not about to launch into a new field of judicial review if it seemed
that this field of review was simply the preference of a small
political minority.  Although my focus in the case was not to
demonstrate how bad the Sonny Bono Act was but to demonstrate that it
was unconstitutional, my hope was to make this argument against a
background of briefs that covered the full range of political
views. To show that this claim against the CTEA was grounded in
<emphasis>law</emphasis> and not politics, then, we tried to gather
the widest range of credible critics&mdash;credible not because they
were rich and famous, but because they, in the aggregate, demonstrated
that this law was unconstitutional regardless of one's politics.

<indexterm><primary>Eagle Forum</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Schlafly, Phyllis</primary></indexterm>
<para>
The first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly's
organization, Eagle Forum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the
very beginning.  Mrs. Schlafly viewed the CTEA as a sellout by
Congress. In November 1998, she wrote a stinging editorial attacking
the Republican Congress for allowing the law to pass. As she wrote,
<quote>Do you sometimes wonder why bills that create a financial windfall to
narrow special interests slide easily through the intricate
legislative process, while bills that benefit the general public seem
to get bogged down?</quote>  The answer, as the editorial documented, was the
power of money.  Schlafly enumerated Disney's contributions to the key
players on the committees. It was money, not justice, that gave Mickey
Mouse twenty more years in Disney's control, Schlafly argued.
</para>
<para>
In the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief
supporting our position. Their brief made the argument that became the
core claim in the Supreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of
existing copyrights, there is no limit to Congress's power to set
terms.  That strong conservative argument persuaded a strong
conservative judge, Judge Sentelle.

history of the Progress Clause. And of course, there was a new brief

This economists' brief was signed by seventeen economists, including
five Nobel Prize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan,

the list of Nobel winners demonstrates, spanned the political
spectrum. Their conclusions were powerful: There was no plausible
claim that extending the terms of existing copyrights would do
anything to increase incentives to create. Such extensions were
nothing more than <quote>rent-seeking</quote>&mdash;the fancy term economists use
to describe special-interest legislation gone wild.

The same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we gathered
to write our briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had been with
us from the start. But when the case got to the Supreme Court, we
added three lawyers to help us frame this argument to this Court: Alan
Morrison, a lawyer from Public Citizen, a Washington group that had
made constitutional history with a series of seminal victories in the
Supreme Court defending individual rights; my colleague and dean,
Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued many cases in the Court, and

<!-- PAGE BREAK 240 -->
who had advised us early on about a First Amendment strategy; and
finally, former solicitor general Charles Fried.

<para>
Fried was a special victory for our side. Every other former solicitor
general was hired by the other side to defend Congress's power to give
media companies the special favor of extended copyright terms. Fried
was the only one who turned down that lucrative assignment to stand up
for something he believed in. He had been Ronald Reagan's chief lawyer
in the Supreme Court. He had helped craft the line of cases that
limited Congress's power in the context of the Commerce Clause. And
while he had argued many positions in the Supreme Court that I
personally disagreed with, his joining the cause was a vote of
confidence in our argument.
</para>
<para>
The government, in defending the statute, had its collection of
friends, as well. Significantly, however, none of these <quote>friends</quote> included
historians or economists. The briefs on the other side of the case were
written exclusively by major media companies, congressmen, and
copyright holders.
</para>
<para>
The media companies were not surprising. They had the most to gain
from the law. The congressmen were not surprising either&mdash;they
were defending their power and, indirectly, the gravy train of
contributions such power induced. And of course it was not surprising
that the copyright holders would defend the idea that they should
continue to have the right to control who did what with content they
wanted to control.

</para>
<para>
This argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this
debate.  When Congress decides to extend the term of existing
copyrights, Congress is making a choice about which speakers it will
favor.  Famous and beloved copyright owners, such as the Gershwin
estate and Dr. Seuss, come to Congress and say, <quote>Give us twenty years
to control the speech about these icons of American culture. We'll do
better with them than anyone else.</quote> Congress of course likes to reward
the popular and famous by giving them what they want. But when
Congress gives people an exclusive right to speak in a certain way,
that's just what the First Amendment is traditionally meant to block.
</para>
<para>
We argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the CTEA
mean that there was no limit to the power of Congress to extend
copyrights&mdash;extensions that would further concentrate the market;
it would also mean that there was no limit to Congress's power to play
favorites, through copyright, with who has the right to speak.

The Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One camp we
called <quote>the Conservatives.</quote> The other we called <quote>the Rest.</quote>  The
Conservatives included Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas. These five had
been the most consistent in limiting Congress's power. They were the
five who had supported the <citetitle>Lopez/Morrison</citetitle> line
of cases that said that an enumerated power had to be interpreted to
assure that Congress's powers had limits.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Breyer, Stephen</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm id='idxginsburg' class='startofrange'><primary>Ginsburg, Ruth Bader</primary></indexterm>
<para>
The Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on
Congress's power. These four&mdash;Justice Stevens, Justice Souter,
Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer&mdash;had repeatedly argued that
the Constitution
<!-- PAGE BREAK 242 -->
gives Congress broad discretion to decide how best to implement its
powers. In case after case, these justices had argued that the Court's
role should be one of deference. Though the votes of these four
justices were the votes that I personally had most consistently agreed
with, they were also the votes that we were least likely to get.
</para>
<para>
In particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg's. In addition to
her general view about deference to Congress (except where issues of
gender are involved), she had been particularly deferential in the
context of intellectual property protections. She and her daughter (an
excellent and well-known intellectual property scholar) were cut from
the same intellectual property cloth. We expected she would agree with
the writings of her daughter: that Congress had the power in this
context to do as it wished, even if what Congress wished made little
sense.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Breyer, Stephen</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Close behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also viewed as
unlikely allies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter strongly
favored deference to Congress, as did Justice Breyer. But both were
also very sensitive to free speech concerns. And as we strongly
believed, there was a very important free speech argument against
these retrospective extensions.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxsupremecourtusfactionsof' class='endofrange'/>
<indexterm startref='idxginsburg' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
The only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice
Stevens. History will record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest
judges on this Court. His votes are consistently eclectic, which just
means that no simple ideology explains where he will stand. But he
had consistently argued for limits in the context of intellectual property
generally. We were fairly confident he would recognize limits here.
</para>
<para>
This analysis of <quote>the Rest</quote> showed most clearly where our focus had to
be: on the Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open these
five and get at least a majority to go our way. Thus, the single
overriding argument that animated our claim rested on the
Conservatives' most important jurisprudential innovation&mdash;the
argument that Judge Sentelle had relied upon in the Court of Appeals,
that Congress's power must be interpreted so that its enumerated
powers have limits.

This then was the core of our strategy&mdash;a strategy for which I am
responsible. We would get the Court to see that just as with the
<citetitle>Lopez</citetitle>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 243 -->
case, under the government's argument here, Congress would always have
unlimited power to extend existing terms. If anything was plain about
Congress's power under the Progress Clause, it was that this power was
supposed to be <quote>limited.</quote> Our aim would be to get the Court to
reconcile <citetitle>Eldred</citetitle> with
<citetitle>Lopez</citetitle>: If Congress's power to regulate commerce
was limited, then so, too, must Congress's power to regulate copyright
be limited.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role='strong'>The argument</emphasis> on the government's
side came down to this: Congress has done it before. It should be
allowed to do it again. The government claimed that from the very
beginning, Congress has been extending the term of existing
copyrights. So, the government argued, the Court should not now say
that practice is unconstitutional.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxcongressuscopyrighttermsextendedby5' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
There was some truth to the government's claim, but not much. We
certainly agreed that Congress had extended existing terms in 1831
and in 1909. And of course, in 1962, Congress began extending 
		existing
terms regularly&mdash;eleven times in forty years.
</para>
<para>
But this <quote>consistency</quote> should be kept in perspective. Congress 
		extended
existing terms once in the first hundred years of the Republic.
It then extended existing terms once again in the next fifty. Those rare
extensions are in contrast to the now regular practice of extending 
		existing
terms. Whatever restraint Congress had had in the past, that 
		restraint
was now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of extensions; there
was no reason to expect that cycle would end. This Court had not 
		hesitated
to intervene where Congress was in a similar cycle of extension.
There was no reason it couldn't intervene here.

<para>
I was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a

the power to set terms. Going with the government would mean that
terms would be effectively unlimited; going with us would give 
		Congress
a clear line to follow: Don't extend existing terms. The moots
were an effective practice; I found ways to take every question back to

<quote>I'm just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won't be
willing to upset this practice that the government says has been a

He may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but
he didn't understand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the
right thing&mdash;not because of politics but because it was right. As a law
professor, I had spent my life teaching my students that this Court
does the right thing&mdash;not because of politics but because it is right. As
I listened to Ayer's plea for passion in pressing politics, I understood
his point, and I rejected it. Our argument was right. That was enough.
Let the politicians learn to see that it was also good.

Not everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can
ask for seats they control. (I asked Justice Scalia's chambers for seats for
my parents, for example.) Members of the Supreme Court bar can get
a seat in a special section reserved for them. And senators and

have a special place where they get to sit, too. And finally, of
course, the press has a gallery, as do clerks working for the Justices on
the Court. As we entered that morning, there was no place that was
not taken. This was an argument about intellectual property law, yet
the halls were filled. As I walked in to take my seat at the front of the
Court, I saw my parents sitting on the left. As I sat down at the table,
I saw Jack Valenti sitting in the special section ordinarily reserved for
family of the Justices.

When Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal.
Olson's flailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed
to the academic, not the practical. The government was arguing as if
this were the first case ever to consider limits on Congress's
Copyright and Patent Clause power. Ever the professor and not the
advocate, I closed by pointing out the long history of the Court
imposing limits on Congress's power in the name of the Copyright and
Patent Clause&mdash; indeed, the very first case striking a law of
Congress as exceeding a specific enumerated power was based upon the
Copyright and Patent Clause. All true. But it wasn't going to move the
Court to my side.

</para>
<para>
The government had been asked over and over again, what is the limit?
Over and over again, it had answered there is no limit. This was
precisely the answer I wanted the Court to hear. For I could not
imagine how the Court could understand that the government believed
Congress's power was unlimited under the terms of the Copyright
Clause, and sustain the government's argument. The solicitor general
had made my argument for me. No matter how often I tried, I could not
understand how the Court could find that Congress's power under the
Commerce Clause was limited, but under the Copyright Clause,
unlimited. In those rare moments when I let myself believe that we may
have prevailed, it was because I felt this Court&mdash;in particular,
the Conservatives&mdash;would feel itself constrained by the rule of
law that it had established elsewhere.

Justices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens's
opinion was crafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition
of intellectual property law should not support this unjustified
extension of terms. He based his argument on a parallel analysis that
had governed in the context of patents (so had we). But the rest of
the Court discounted the parallel&mdash;without explaining how the
very same words in the Progress Clause could come to mean totally
different things depending upon whether the words were about patents
or copyrights.  The Court let Justice Stevens's charge go unanswered.

<!-- PAGE BREAK 250 -->
Justice Breyer's opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever
written, was external to the Constitution. He argued that the term of
copyrights has become so long as to be effectively unlimited. We had
said that under the current term, a copyright gave an author 99.8
percent of the value of a perpetual term. Breyer said we were wrong,
that the actual number was 99.9997 percent of a perpetual term. Either
way, the point was clear: If the Constitution said a term had to be
<quote>limited,</quote> and the existing term was so long as to be effectively
unlimited, then it was unconstitutional.

Most have a much more pragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that this

the framers' values were important, I fought the idea, because I
didn't want to believe that that is how this Court decides. I insisted
on arguing this case as if it were a simple application of a set of
principles.  I had an argument that followed in logic. I didn't need
to waste my time showing it should also follow in popularity.

As I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I

that this unchecked power will cause could have been made clear to

idiotically, corrected his question. Justice Souter in good faith
wanted to be shown the First Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher,
reframed the question to make the logical point. I had shown them how
they could strike this law of Congress if they wanted to. There were a
hundred places where I could have helped them want to, yet my
stubbornness, my refusal to give in, stopped me. I have stood before
hundreds of audiences trying to persuade; I have used passion in that

</para>
<para>
Indeed, many recognized the obvious benefit of the registration
requirement.  For one of the hardest things about the current system
for people who want to license content is that there is no obvious
place to look for the current copyright owners. Since registration is
not required, since marking content is not required, since no
formality at all is required, it is often impossibly hard to locate
copyright owners to ask permission to use or license their work. This
system would lower these costs, by establishing at least one registry
where copyright owners could be identified.

<!-- PAGE BREAK 257 -->
As I described in chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="property-i"/>, formalities in copyright law were
removed in 1976, when Congress followed the Europeans by abandoning
any formal requirement before a copyright is granted.<footnote><para>
<!-- f1. -->
<indexterm><primary>German copyright law</primary></indexterm>
Until the 1908 Berlin Act of the Berne Convention, national copyright
legislation sometimes made protection depend upon compliance with
formalities such as registration, deposit, and affixation of notice of
the author's claim of copyright. However, starting with the 1908 act,
every text of the Convention has provided that <quote>the enjoyment and the
exercise</quote> of rights guaranteed by the Convention <quote>shall not be subject
to any formality.</quote>  The prohibition against formalities is presently
embodied in Article 5(2) of the Paris Text of the Berne
Convention. Many countries continue to impose some form of deposit or
registration requirement, albeit not as a condition of
copyright. French law, for example, requires the deposit of copies of
works in national repositories, principally the National Museum.
Copies of books published in the United Kingdom must be deposited in
the British Library. The German Copyright Act provides for a Registrar
of Authors where the author's true name can be filed in the case of
anonymous or pseudonymous works. Paul Goldstein, <citetitle>International
Intellectual Property Law, Cases and Materials</citetitle> (New York: Foundation
Press, 2001), 153&ndash;54.  </para></footnote>
The Europeans are said to view copyright as a <quote>natural right.</quote> Natural
rights don't need forms to exist. Traditions, like the Anglo-American
tradition that required copyright owners to follow form if their
rights were to be protected, did not, the Europeans thought, properly
respect the dignity of the author. My right as a creator turns on my
creativity, not upon the special favor of the government.
</para>
<para>
That's great rhetoric. It sounds wonderfully romantic. But it is
absurd copyright policy. It is absurd especially for authors, because
a world without formalities harms the creator. The ability to spread
<quote>Walt Disney creativity</quote> is destroyed when there is no simple way to
know what's protected and what's not.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Berne Convention (1908)</primary></indexterm>
<para>
The fight against formalities achieved its first real victory in
Berlin in 1908. International copyright lawyers amended the Berne
Convention in 1908, to require copyright terms of life plus fifty
years, as well as the abolition of copyright formalities. The
formalities were hated because the stories of inadvertent loss were
increasingly common. It was as if a Charles Dickens character ran all
copyright offices, and the failure to dot an <citetitle>i</citetitle> or cross a
<citetitle>t</citetitle> resulted in the loss of widows' only income.
</para>
<para>
These complaints were real and sensible. And the strictness of the
formalities, especially in the United States, was absurd. The law
should always have ways of forgiving innocent mistakes. There is no
reason copyright law couldn't, as well. Rather than abandoning
formalities totally, the response in Berlin should have been to
embrace a more equitable system of registration.
</para>
<para>
Even that would have been resisted, however, because registration
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was still expensive. It was
also a hassle. The abolishment of formalities promised not only to save
the starving widows, but also to lighten an unnecessary regulatory 
		burden
imposed upon creators.
</para>
<para>
In addition to the practical complaint of authors in 1908, there was
a moral claim as well. There was no reason that creative property

<!-- PAGE BREAK 258 -->
should be a second-class form of property. If a carpenter builds a
table, his rights over the table don't depend upon filing a form with
the government.  He has a property right over the table <quote>naturally,</quote>
and he can assert that right against anyone who would steal the table,
whether or not he has informed the government of his ownership of the
table.
</para>
<para>
This argument is correct, but its implications are misleading. For the
argument in favor of formalities does not depend upon creative
property being second-class property. The argument in favor of
formalities turns upon the special problems that creative property
presents.  The law of formalities responds to the special physics of
creative property, to assure that it can be efficiently and fairly
spread.
</para>
<para>
No one thinks, for example, that land is second-class property just
because you have to register a deed with a court if your sale of land
is to be effective. And few would think a car is second-class property
just because you must register the car with the state and tag it with
a license.  In both of those cases, everyone sees that there is an
important reason to secure registration&mdash;both because it makes
the markets more efficient and because it better secures the rights of
the owner. Without a registration system for land, landowners would
perpetually have to guard their property. With registration, they can
simply point the police to a deed. Without a registration system for
cars, auto theft would be much easier. With a registration system, the
thief has a high burden to sell a stolen car. A slight burden is
placed on the property owner, but those burdens produce a much better
system of protection for property generally.
</para>
<para>
It is similarly special physics that makes formalities important in
copyright law. Unlike a carpenter's table, there's nothing in nature that
makes it relatively obvious who might own a particular bit of creative
property. A recording of Lyle Lovett's latest album can exist in a billion
places without anything necessarily linking it back to a particular
owner. And like a car, there's no way to buy and sell creative property
with confidence unless there is some simple way to authenticate who is
the author and what rights he has. Simple transactions are destroyed in

This was the understanding of the problem with the Sonny Bono
Act that we tried to demonstrate to the Court. This was the part it

But now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the
inability to know what is protected and what is not protected becomes
a huge and obvious burden on the creative process. If the only way a
library can offer an Internet exhibit about the New Deal is to hire a

copyright system is burdening creativity in a way that has never been

<para>
The Eldred Act was designed to respond to exactly this problem. If
it is worth $1 to you, then register your work and you can get the

to get your permission if they want to use your work. And you will get
the benefit of an extended copyright term.
</para>
<para>
If it isn't worth it to you to register to get the benefit of an extended
term, then it shouldn't be worth it for the government to defend your

movie based on it. It should become free if it is not worth $1 to you.
</para>
<para>
Some worry about the burden on authors. Won't the burden of
registering the work mean that the $1 is really misleading? Isn't the
hassle worth more than $1? Isn't that the real problem with
registration?
</para>
<para>
It is. The hassle is terrible. The system that exists now is awful. I
completely agree that the Copyright Office has done a terrible job (no
doubt because they are terribly funded) in enabling simple and cheap

<!-- PAGE BREAK 260 -->
registrations. Any real solution to the problem of formalities must
address the real problem of <emphasis>governments</emphasis> standing
at the core of any system of formalities. In this book, I offer such a
solution. That solution essentially remakes the Copyright Office. For
now, assume it was Amazon that ran the registration system. Assume it
was one-click registration.  The Eldred Act would propose a simple,
one-click registration fifty years after a work was published. Based
upon historical data, that system would move up to 98 percent of
commercial work, commercial work that no longer had a commercial life,
into the public domain within fifty years. What do you think?

me pointing to representatives who might be willing to introduce the
Eldred Act. And I had a few who directly suggested that they might be
willing to take the first step.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Lofgren, Zoe</primary></indexterm>
<para>
One representative, Zoe Lofgren of California, went so far as to get
the bill drafted. The draft solved any problem with international
law. It imposed the simplest requirement upon copyright owners
possible. In May 2003, it looked as if the bill would be
introduced. On May 16, I posted on the Eldred Act blog, <quote>we are
close.</quote> There was a general reaction in the blog community that
something good might happen here.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Valenti, Jack</primary><secondary>Eldred Act opposed by</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
But at this stage, the lobbyists began to intervene. Jack Valenti and
the MPAA general counsel came to the congresswoman's office to give
the view of the MPAA. Aided by his lawyer, as Valenti told me, Valenti
informed the congresswoman that the MPAA would oppose the Eldred
Act. The reasons are embarrassingly thin. More importantly, their
thinness shows something clear about what this debate is really about.
</para>
<para>
The MPAA argued first that Congress had <quote>firmly rejected the central
concept in the proposed bill</quote>&mdash;that copyrights be renewed. That
was true, but irrelevant, as Congress's <quote>firm rejection</quote> had occurred
<!-- PAGE BREAK 261 -->
long before the Internet made subsequent uses much more likely.
Second, they argued that the proposal would harm poor copyright
owners&mdash;apparently those who could not afford the $1 fee. Third,
they argued that Congress had determined that extending a copyright
term would encourage restoration work. Maybe in the case of the small
percentage of work covered by copyright law that is still commercially
valuable, but again this was irrelevant, as the proposal would not cut
off the extended term unless the $1 fee was not paid. Fourth, the MPAA
argued that the bill would impose <quote>enormous</quote> costs, since a
registration system is not free. True enough, but those costs are
certainly less than the costs of clearing the rights for a copyright
whose owner is not known. Fifth, they worried about the risks if the
copyright to a story underlying a film were to pass into the public
domain. But what risk is that? If it is in the public domain, then the
film is a valid derivative use.
</para>
<para>
Finally, the MPAA argued that existing law enabled copyright owners to
do this if they wanted. But the whole point is that there are
thousands of copyright owners who don't even know they have a
copyright to give. Whether they are free to give away their copyright
or not&mdash;a controversial claim in any case&mdash;unless they know
about a copyright, they're not likely to.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis role='strong'>At the beginning</emphasis> of this book, I
told two stories about the law reacting to changes in technology. In
the one, common sense prevailed.  In the other, common sense was
delayed. The difference between the two stories was the power of the
opposition&mdash;the power of the side that fought to defend the
status quo. In both cases, a new technology threatened old
interests. But in only one case did those interest's have the power to
protect themselves against this new competitive threat.
</para>
<para>
I used these two cases as a way to frame the war that this book has
been about. For here, too, a new technology is forcing the law to react.
And here, too, we should ask, is the law following or resisting common
sense? If common sense supports the law, what explains this common
sense?
</para>
<para>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 262 -->
When the issue is piracy, it is right for the law to back the
copyright owners. The commercial piracy that I described is wrong and
harmful, and the law should work to eliminate it. When the issue is
p2p sharing, it is easy to understand why the law backs the owners
still: Much of this sharing is wrong, even if much is harmless. When
the issue is copyright terms for the Mickey Mouses of the world, it is
possible still to understand why the law favors Hollywood: Most people
don't recognize the reasons for limiting copyright terms; it is thus
still possible to see good faith within the resistance.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Kelly, Kevin</primary></indexterm>
<para>
But when the copyright owners oppose a proposal such as the Eldred
Act, then, finally, there is an example that lays bare the naked
selfinterest driving this war. This act would free an extraordinary
range of content that is otherwise unused. It wouldn't interfere with
any copyright owner's desire to exercise continued control over his
content. It would simply liberate what Kevin Kelly calls the <quote>Dark
Content</quote> that fills archives around the world. So when the warriors
oppose a change like this, we should ask one simple question:
</para>
<para>
What does this industry really want?
</para>
<para>
With very little effort, the warriors could protect their content. So
the effort to block something like the Eldred Act is not really about
protecting <emphasis>their</emphasis> content. The effort to block the
Eldred Act is an effort to assure that nothing more passes into the
public domain. It is another step to assure that the public domain
will never compete, that there will be no use of content that is not
commercially controlled, and that there will be no commercial use of
content that doesn't require <emphasis>their</emphasis> permission
first.
</para>
<para>
The opposition to the Eldred Act reveals how extreme the other side
is. The most powerful and sexy and well loved of lobbies really has as
its aim not the protection of <quote>property</quote> but the rejection of a
tradition.  Their aim is not simply to protect what is
theirs. <emphasis>Their aim is to assure that all there is is what is
theirs</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
It is not hard to understand why the warriors take this view. It is not
hard to see why it would benefit them if the competition of the public

<!-- PAGE BREAK 263 -->
domain tied to the Internet could somehow be quashed. Just as RCA
feared the competition of FM, they fear the competition of a public
domain connected to a public that now has the means to create with it
and to share its own creation.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Causby, Thomas Lee</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Causby, Tinie</primary></indexterm>
<para>
What is hard to understand is why the public takes this view. It is
as if the law made airplanes trespassers. The MPAA stands with the
Causbys and demands that their remote and useless property rights be
respected, so that these remote and forgotten copyright holders might
block the progress of others.
</para>
<para>
All this seems to follow easily from this untroubled acceptance of the
<quote>property</quote> in intellectual property. Common sense supports it, and so
long as it does, the assaults will rain down upon the technologies of
the Internet. The consequence will be an increasing <quote>permission
society.</quote>  The past can be cultivated only if you can identify the
owner and gain permission to build upon his work. The future will be
controlled by this dead (and often unfindable) hand of the past.

<emphasis role='strong'>There are more</emphasis> than 35 million
people with the AIDS virus worldwide. Twenty-five million of them live
in sub-Saharan Africa.  Seventeen million have already died. Seventeen
million Africans is proportional percentage-wise to seven million
Americans. More importantly, it is seventeen million Africans.
</para>
<para>
There is no cure for AIDS, but there are drugs to slow its
progression.  These antiretroviral therapies are still experimental,
but they have already had a dramatic effect. In the United States,
AIDS patients who regularly take a cocktail of these drugs increase
their life expectancy by ten to twenty years. For some, the drugs make
the disease almost invisible.
</para>
<para>
These drugs are expensive. When they were first introduced in the
United States, they cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per person per
year. Today, some cost $25,000 per year. At these prices, of course, no
African nation can afford the drugs for the vast majority of its 
		population:
$15,000 is thirty times the per capita gross national product of
Zimbabwe. At these prices, the drugs are totally unavailable.<footnote><para>

These prices are not high because the ingredients of the drugs are
expensive. These prices are high because the drugs are protected by
patents. The drug companies that produced these life-saving mixes
enjoy at least a twenty-year monopoly for their inventions. They use
that monopoly power to extract the most they can from the market. That
power is in turn used to keep the prices high.
</para>
<para>
There are many who are skeptical of patents, especially drug
patents. I am not. Indeed, of all the areas of research that might be
supported by patents, drug research is, in my view, the clearest case
where patents are needed. The patent gives the drug company some
assurance that if it is successful in inventing a new drug to treat a
disease, it will be able to earn back its investment and more. This is
socially an extremely valuable incentive. I am the last person who
would argue that the law should abolish it, at least without other
changes.
</para>
<para>
But it is one thing to support patents, even drug patents. It is
another thing to determine how best to deal with a crisis. And as
African leaders began to recognize the devastation that AIDS was
bringing, they started looking for ways to import HIV treatments at
costs significantly below the market price.

In 1997, South Africa tried one tack. It passed a law to allow the

That same year, more than forty pharmaceutical companies began
proceedings in the South African courts to challenge the government's
actions. The United States was then joined by other governments from
the EU. Their claim, and the claim of the pharmaceutical companies,
was that South Africa was violating its obligations under
international law by discriminating against a particular kind of
patent&mdash; pharmaceutical patents. The demand of these governments,
with the United States in the lead, was that South Africa respect
these patents as it respects any other patent, regardless of any
effect on the treatment of AIDS within South Africa.<footnote><para>

We should place the intervention by the United States in context.  No
doubt patents are not the most important reason that Africans don't
have access to drugs. Poverty and the total absence of an effective
health care infrastructure matter more. But whether patents are the
most important reason or not, the price of drugs has an effect on
their demand, and patents affect price. And so, whether massive or
marginal, there was an effect from our government's intervention to
stop the flow of medications into Africa.
</para>
<para>
By stopping the flow of HIV treatment into Africa, the United
States government was not saving drugs for United States citizens.
This is not like wheat (if they eat it, we can't); instead, the flow that the
United States intervened to stop was, in effect, a flow of knowledge:
information about how to take chemicals that exist within Africa, and
turn those chemicals into drugs that would save 15 to 30 million lives.
</para>
<para>
Nor was the intervention by the United States going to protect the
profits of United States drug companies&mdash;at least, not substantially. It
was not as if these countries were in the position to buy the drugs for
the prices the drug companies were charging. Again, the Africans are
wildly too poor to afford these drugs at the offered prices. Stopping the
parallel import of these drugs would not substantially increase the sales
by U.S. companies.
</para>
<para>
Instead, the argument in favor of restricting this flow of
information, which was needed to save the lives of millions, was an

Some blame the drug companies. I don't. They are corporations.
Their managers are ordered by law to make money for the corporation.
They push a certain patent policy not because of ideals, but because it is

most money because of a certain corruption within our political system&mdash;
a corruption the drug companies are certainly not responsible for.

The corruption is our own politicians' failure of integrity. For the
drug companies would love&mdash;they say, and I believe them&mdash;to
sell their drugs as cheaply as they can to countries in Africa and
elsewhere.  There are issues they'd have to resolve to make sure the
drugs didn't get back into the United States, but those are mere
problems of technology.  They could be overcome.

A different problem, however, could not be overcome. This is the
fear of the grandstanding politician who would call the presidents of
the drug companies before a Senate or House hearing, and ask, <quote>How
is it you can sell this HIV drug in Africa for only $1 a pill, but the same
drug would cost an American $1,500?</quote> Because there is no <quote>sound

avoiding the first step. They reinforce the idea that property should be

unintended consequence that perhaps millions die. And that rational
strategy thus becomes framed in terms of this ideal&mdash;the sanctity of an

A sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support the patent
system without having to reach everyone everywhere in exactly the same
way. Just as a sensible copyright policy could endorse and strongly
support a copyright system without having to regulate the spread of
culture perfectly and forever, a sensible patent policy could endorse
and strongly support a patent system without having to block the
spread of drugs to a country not rich enough to afford market prices
in any case. A sensible policy, in other words, could be a balanced
policy. For most of our history, both copyright and patent policies
were balanced in just this sense.

At the request of a wide range of interests, WIPO had decided to hold
a meeting to discuss <quote>open and collaborative projects to create public
goods.</quote> These are projects that have been successful in producing
public goods without relying exclusively upon a proprietary use of
intellectual property. Examples include the Internet and the World
Wide Web, both of which were developed on the basis of protocols in
the public domain. It included an emerging trend to support open
academic journals, including the Public Library of Science project
that I describe in chapter 
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="c-afterword"/>.  It
included a project to develop single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
which are thought to have great significance in biomedical
research. (That nonprofit project comprised a consortium of the
Wellcome Trust and pharmaceutical and technological companies,
including Amersham Biosciences, AstraZeneca,

Aventis, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Hoffmann-La Roche,

The aim of the meeting was to consider this wide range of projects

property was balanced by agreements to keep access open or to impose
limitations on the way in which proprietary claims might be used.

noncommercial work. They primarily involved science, but from many

Indeed, I was once publicly scolded for not recognizing this fact
about WIPO. In February 2003, I delivered a keynote address to a
preparatory conference for the World Summit on the Information Society
(WSIS). At a press conference before the address, I was asked what I
would say. I responded that I would be talking a little about the
importance of balance in intellectual property for the development of
an information society. The moderator for the event then promptly
interrupted to inform me and the assembled reporters that no question
about intellectual property would be discussed by WSIS, since those
questions were the exclusive domain of WIPO. In the talk that I had
prepared, I had actually made the issue of intellectual property
relatively minor. But after this astonishing statement, I made
intellectual property the sole focus of my talk. There was no way to
talk about an <quote>Information Society</quote> unless one also talked about the
range of information and culture that would be free. My talk did not
make my immoderate moderator very happy. And she was no doubt correct
that the scope of intellectual property protections was ordinarily the
stuff of
<!-- PAGE BREAK 271 -->
WIPO. But in my view, there couldn't be too much of a conversation
about how much intellectual property is needed, since in my view, the
very idea of balance in intellectual property had been lost.
</para>
<para>
So whether or not WSIS can discuss balance in intellectual property, I
had thought it was taken for granted that WIPO could and should. And
thus the meeting about <quote>open and collaborative projects to create
public goods</quote> seemed perfectly appropriate within the WIPO agenda.

the subject. From its perspective, a conference to discuss open source
and free software would be like a conference to discuss Apple's
operating system. Both open source and free software compete with
Microsoft's software. And internationally, many governments have begun

I don't mean to enter that debate here. It is important only to
make clear that the distinction is not between commercial and
noncommercial software. There are many important companies that depend
fundamentally upon open source and free software, IBM being the most
prominent. IBM is increasingly shifting its focus to the GNU/Linux
operating system, the most famous bit of <quote>free software</quote>&mdash;and IBM
is emphatically a commercial entity. Thus, to support <quote>open source and
free software</quote> is not to oppose commercial entities. It is, instead,
to support a mode of software development that is different from
Microsoft's.<footnote><para>
<!-- f8. -->
Microsoft's position about free and open source software is more
sophisticated.  As it has repeatedly asserted, it has no problem with
<quote>open source</quote> software or software in the public domain. Microsoft's
principal opposition is to <quote>free software</quote> licensed under a <quote>copyleft</quote>
license, meaning a license that requires the licensee to adopt the
same terms on any derivative work. See Bradford L. Smith, <quote>The Future
of Software: Enabling the Marketplace to Decide,</quote> <citetitle>Government Policy

More important for our purposes, to support <quote>open source and free
software</quote> is not to oppose copyright. <quote>Open source and free software</quote>
is not software in the public domain. Instead, like Microsoft's
software, the copyright owners of free and open source software insist
quite strongly that the terms of their software license be respected
by
<!-- PAGE BREAK 272 -->
adopters of free and open source software. The terms of that license
are no doubt different from the terms of a proprietary software
license.  Free software licensed under the General Public License
(GPL), for example, requires that the source code for the software be
made available by anyone who modifies and redistributes the
software. But that requirement is effective only if copyright governs
software. If copyright did not govern software, then free software
could not impose the same kind of requirements on its adopters. It
thus depends upon copyright law just as Microsoft does.

It is therefore understandable that as a proprietary software
developer, Microsoft would oppose this WIPO meeting, and
understandable that it would use its lobbyists to get the United
States government to oppose it, as well. And indeed, that is just what
was reported to have happened. According to Jonathan Krim of the

I don't blame Microsoft for doing what it can to advance its own

plainly consistent with the law. There was nothing surprising about
its lobbying here, and nothing terribly surprising about the most

What was surprising was the United States government's reason for

<para>
First, they are just flat wrong. As I described, most open source and
free software relies fundamentally upon the intellectual property
right called <quote>copyright</quote>.  Without it, restrictions imposed by those
licenses wouldn't work. Thus, to say it <quote>runs counter</quote> to the mission
of promoting intellectual property rights reveals an extraordinary gap
in understanding&mdash;the sort of mistake that is excusable in a
first-year law student, but an embarrassment from a high government
official dealing with intellectual property issues.

Second, who ever said that WIPO's exclusive aim was to <quote>promote</quote>
intellectual property maximally? As I had been scolded at the
preparatory conference of WSIS, WIPO is to consider not only how best
to protect intellectual property, but also what the best balance of
intellectual property is. As every economist and lawyer knows, the
hard question in intellectual property law is to find that
balance. But that there should be limits is, I had thought,
uncontested. One wants to ask Ms. Boland, are generic drugs (drugs
based on drugs whose patent has expired) contrary to the WIPO mission?
Does the public domain weaken intellectual property? Would it have
been better if the protocols of the Internet had been patented?

<indexterm><primary>Gates, Bill</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Third, even if one believed that the purpose of WIPO was to maximize
intellectual property rights, in our tradition, intellectual property
rights are held by individuals and corporations. They get to decide
what to do with those rights because, again, they are
<emphasis>their</emphasis> rights. If they want to <quote>waive</quote> or
<quote>disclaim</quote> their rights, that is, within our tradition, totally
appropriate. When Bill Gates gives away more than $20 billion to do
good in the world, that is not inconsistent with the objectives of the
property system. That is, on the contrary, just what a property system
is supposed to be about: giving individuals the right to decide what
to do with <emphasis>their</emphasis> property.

When Ms. Boland says that there is something wrong with a meeting
<quote>which has as its purpose to disclaim or waive such rights,</quote> she's
saying that WIPO has an interest in interfering with the choices of
<!-- PAGE BREAK 274 -->
the individuals who own intellectual property rights. That somehow,
WIPO's objective should be to stop an individual from <quote>waiving</quote> or
<quote>disclaiming</quote> an intellectual property right. That the interest of
WIPO is not just that intellectual property rights be maximized, but
that they also should be exercised in the most extreme and restrictive
way possible.

There is a history of just such a property system that is well known

feudalism, not only was property held by a relatively small number of
individuals and entities. And not only were the rights that ran with
that property powerful and extensive. But the feudal system had a
strong interest in assuring that property holders within that system
not weaken feudalism by liberating people or property within their
control to the free market. Feudalism depended upon maximum control
and concentration. It fought any freedom that might interfere with
that control.

When this battle broke, I blogged it. A spirited debate within the
comment section ensued. Ms. Boland had a number of supporters who
tried to show why her comments made sense. But there was one comment
that was particularly depressing for me. An anonymous poster wrote,
</para>
<blockquote>
<indexterm startref='idxintellectualpropertyrightsinternationalorganizationonissuesof2' class='endofrange'/>
<indexterm startref='idxworldintellectualpropertyorganizationwipo2' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
George, you misunderstand Lessig: He's only talking about the world as
it should be (<quote>the goal of WIPO, and the goal of any government,
should be to promote the right balance of intellectual property rights,
not simply to promote intellectual property rights</quote>), not as it is. If
we were talking about the world as it is, then of course Boland didn't
say anything wrong. But in the world
<!-- PAGE BREAK 275 -->
as Lessig would have it, then of course she did. Always pay attention
to the distinction between Lessig's world and ours.
</para>
</blockquote>
<para>
I missed the irony the first time I read it. I read it quickly and
thought the poster was supporting the idea that seeking balance was
what our government should be doing. (Of course, my criticism of Ms.
Boland was not about whether she was seeking balance or not; my
criticism was that her comments betrayed a first-year law student's
mistake. I have no illusion about the extremism of our government,
whether Republican or Democrat. My only illusion apparently is about
whether our government should speak the truth or not.)
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxbolandlois' class='endofrange'/>
<para>
Obviously, however, the poster was not supporting that idea.  Instead,
the poster was ridiculing the very idea that in the real world, the
<quote>goal</quote> of a government should be <quote>to promote the right balance</quote> of
intellectual property. That was obviously silly to him. And it
obviously betrayed, he believed, my own silly utopianism. <quote>Typical for
an academic,</quote> the poster might well have continued.
</para>
<para>
I understand criticism of academic utopianism. I think utopianism is
silly, too, and I'd be the first to poke fun at the absurdly
unrealistic ideals of academics throughout history (and not just in
our own country's history).
</para>
<para>
But when it has become silly to suppose that the role of our
government should be to <quote>seek balance,</quote> then count me with the silly,
for that means that this has become quite serious indeed. If it should
be obvious to everyone that the government does not seek balance, that
the government is simply the tool of the most powerful lobbyists, that
the idea of holding the government to a different standard is absurd,
that the idea of demanding of the government that it speak truth and
not lies is just na&iuml;ve, then who have we, the most powerful
democracy in the world, become?

It might be crazy to expect a high government official to speak
the truth. It might be crazy to believe that government policy will be
something more than the handmaiden of the most powerful interests.

<emphasis role='strong'>There are moments</emphasis> of hope in this
struggle. And moments that surprise. When the FCC was considering
relaxing ownership rules, which would thereby further increase the
concentration in media ownership, an extraordinary bipartisan
coalition formed to fight this change. For perhaps the first time in
history, interests as diverse as the NRA, the ACLU, Moveon.org,
William Safire, Ted Turner, and CodePink Women for Peace organized to
oppose this change in FCC policy. An astonishing 700,000 letters were
sent to the FCC, demanding more hearings and a different result.
</para>
<para>
This activism did not stop the FCC, but soon after, a broad coalition
in the Senate voted to reverse the FCC decision. The hostile hearings
leading up to that vote revealed just how powerful this movement had
become. There was no substantial support for the FCC's decision, and
there was broad and sustained support for fighting further
concentration in the media.
</para>
<para>
But even this movement misses an important piece of the puzzle.
Largeness as such is not bad. Freedom is not threatened just because
some become very rich, or because there are only a handful of big
players.  The poor quality of Big Macs or Quarter Pounders does not
mean that you can't get a good hamburger from somewhere else.
</para>
<para>
The danger in media concentration comes not from the concentration,
but instead from the feudalism that this concentration, tied to the
change in copyright, produces. It is not just that there are a few
powerful companies that control an ever expanding slice of the
media. It is that this concentration can call upon an equally bloated
range of rights&mdash;property rights of a historically extreme
form&mdash;that makes their bigness bad.
</para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 277 -->
<para>
It is therefore significant that so many would rally to demand
competition and increased diversity. Still, if the rally is understood
as being about bigness alone, it is not terribly surprising. We
Americans have a long history of fighting <quote>big,</quote> wisely or not. That
we could be motivated to fight <quote>big</quote> again is not something new.
</para>
<para>
It would be something new, and something very important, if an equal
number could be rallied to fight the increasing extremism built within
the idea of <quote>intellectual property.</quote> Not because balance is alien to
our tradition; indeed, as I've argued, balance is our tradition. But
because the muscle to think critically about the scope of anything
called <quote>property</quote> is not well exercised within this tradition anymore.

If we were Achilles, this would be our heel. This would be the place

If you step back from the battle I've been describing here, you will
recognize this problem from other contexts. Think about
privacy. Before the Internet, most of us didn't have to worry much
about data about our lives that we broadcast to the world. If you
walked into a bookstore and browsed through some of the works of Karl
Marx, you didn't need to worry about explaining your browsing habits
to your neighbors or boss. The <quote>privacy</quote> of your browsing habits was
assured.

What made it assured?
</para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 283 -->
<para>
Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in chapter
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="property-i"/>, your
privacy was assured because of an inefficient architecture for
gathering data and hence a market constraint (cost) on anyone who
wanted to gather that data. If you were a suspected spy for North
Korea, working for the CIA, no doubt your privacy would not be
assured.  But that's because the CIA would (we hope) find it valuable
enough to spend the thousands required to track you. But for most of
us (again, we can hope), spying doesn't pay. The highly inefficient
architecture of real space means we all enjoy a fairly robust amount
of privacy. That privacy is guaranteed to us by friction. Not by law
(there is no law protecting <quote>privacy</quote> in public places), and in many
places, not by norms (snooping and gossip are just fun), but instead,
by the costs that friction imposes on anyone who would want to spy.

on the Internet. It is the recognition that technology can remove what
friction before gave us that leads many to push for laws to do what 
friction did.<footnote><para>

in an Anxious Age</citetitle> (New York: Random House, 2004) (mapping tradeoffs
between technology and privacy).</para></footnote>
And whether you're in favor of those laws or not, it is the pattern
that is important here. We must take affirmative steps to secure a

<!-- PAGE BREAK 284 -->
kind of freedom that was passively provided before. A change in
technology now forces those who believe in privacy to affirmatively
act where, before, privacy was given by default.

A similar story could be told about the birth of the free software
movement. When computers with software were first made available
commercially, the software&mdash;both the source code and the
binaries&mdash; was free. You couldn't run a program written for a
Data General machine on an IBM machine, so Data General and IBM didn't
care much about controlling their software.
</para>
<indexterm id='idxstallmanrichard' class='startofrange'><primary>Stallman, Richard</primary></indexterm>
<para>
That was the world Richard Stallman was born into, and while he was a
researcher at MIT, he grew to love the community that developed when
one was free to explore and tinker with the software that ran on
machines. Being a smart sort himself, and a talented programmer,
Stallman grew to depend upon the freedom to add to or modify other
people's work.
</para>
<para>
In an academic setting, at least, that's not a terribly radical
idea. In a math department, anyone would be free to tinker with a
proof that someone offered. If you thought you had a better way to
prove a theorem, you could take what someone else did and change
it. In a classics department, if you believed a colleague's
translation of a recently discovered text was flawed, you were free to
improve it. Thus, to Stallman, it seemed obvious that you should be
free to tinker with and improve the code that ran a machine. This,
too, was knowledge. Why shouldn't it be open for criticism like
anything else?
</para>
<indexterm id='idxproprietarycode' class='startofrange'><primary>proprietary code</primary></indexterm>
<para>
No one answered that question. Instead, the architecture of revenue
for computing changed. As it became possible to import programs from
one system to another, it became economically attractive (at least in
the view of some) to hide the code of your program. So, too, as
companies started selling peripherals for mainframe systems. If I
could just take your printer driver and copy it, then that would make
it easier for me to sell a printer to the market than it was for you.
</para>
<para>
Thus, the practice of proprietary code began to spread, and by the
early 1980s, Stallman found himself surrounded by proprietary code.
<!-- PAGE BREAK 285 -->
The world of free software had been erased by a change in the
economics of computing. And as he believed, if he did nothing about
it, then the freedom to change and share software would be
fundamentally weakened.

Therefore, in 1984, Stallman began a project to build a free operating
system, so that at least a strain of free software would survive. That

kernel was added to produce the GNU/Linux operating system.

<para>
Stallman's technique was to use copyright law to build a world of
software that must be kept free. Software licensed under the Free
Software Foundation's GPL cannot be modified and distributed unless
the source code for that software is made available as well. Thus,
anyone building upon GPL'd software would have to make their buildings
free as well. This would assure, Stallman believed, that an ecology of
code would develop that remained free for others to build upon. His
fundamental goal was freedom; innovative creative code was a
byproduct.
</para>
<para>
Stallman was thus doing for software what privacy advocates now
do for privacy. He was seeking a way to rebuild a kind of freedom that
was taken for granted before. Through the affirmative use of licenses
that bind copyrighted code, Stallman was affirmatively reclaiming a
space where free software would survive. He was actively protecting
what before had been passively guaranteed.

As digital technologies develop, it is becoming obvious to many that
printing thousands of copies of journals every month and sending them
to libraries is perhaps not the most efficient way to distribute
knowledge. Instead, journals are increasingly becoming electronic, and
libraries and their users are given access to these electronic
journals through password-protected sites. Something similar to this
has been happening in law for almost thirty years: Lexis and Westlaw
have had electronic versions of case reports available to subscribers
to their service.  Although a Supreme Court opinion is not
copyrighted, and anyone is free to go to a library and read it, Lexis
and Westlaw are also free
<!-- PAGE BREAK 286 -->
to charge users for the privilege of gaining access to that Supreme
Court opinion through their respective services.

There's nothing wrong in general with this, and indeed, the ability to
charge for access to even public domain materials is a good incentive
for people to develop new and innovative ways to spread knowledge.
The law has agreed, which is why Lexis and Westlaw have been allowed
to flourish. And if there's nothing wrong with selling the public
domain, then there could be nothing wrong, in principle, with selling
access to material that is not in the public domain.

But what if the only way to get access to social and scientific data
was through proprietary services? What if no one had the ability to
browse this data except by paying for a subscription?
</para>
<indexterm id='idxlibrariesjournalsin' class='startofrange'><primary>libraries</primary><secondary>journals in</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
As many are beginning to notice, this is increasingly the reality with
scientific journals. When these journals were distributed in paper
form, libraries could make the journals available to anyone who had
access to the library. Thus, patients with cancer could become cancer
experts because the library gave them access. Or patients trying to
understand the risks of a certain treatment could research those risks
by reading all available articles about that treatment. This freedom
was therefore a function of the institution of libraries (norms) and
the technology of paper journals (architecture)&mdash;namely, that it
was very hard to control access to a paper journal.
</para>
<para>
As journals become electronic, however, the publishers are demanding
that libraries not give the general public access to the
journals. This means that the freedoms provided by print journals in
public libraries begin to disappear. Thus, as with privacy and with
software, a changing technology and market shrink a freedom taken for
granted before.

<para>
This shrinking freedom has led many to take affirmative steps to
restore the freedom that has been lost. The Public Library of Science
(PLoS), for example, is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to making
scientific research available to anyone with a Web connection. Authors
<!-- PAGE BREAK 287 -->
of scientific work submit that work to the Public Library of Science.
That work is then subject to peer review. If accepted, the work is
then deposited in a public, electronic archive and made permanently
available for free. PLoS also sells a print version of its work, but
the copyright for the print journal does not inhibit the right of
anyone to redistribute the work for free.
</para>
<indexterm startref='idxlibrariesjournalsin' class='endofrange'/>

This is one of many such efforts to restore a freedom taken for

Enter the Creative Commons. The Creative Commons is a nonprofit
corporation established in Massachusetts, but with its home at
Stanford University. Its aim is to build a layer of
<emphasis>reasonable</emphasis> copyright on top of the extremes that
now reign. It does this by making it easy for people to build upon
other people's work, by making it simple for creators to express the
freedom for others to take and build upon their work. Simple tags,
tied to human-readable descriptions, tied to bulletproof licenses,
make this possible.
</para>
<para>
<emphasis>Simple</emphasis>&mdash;which means without a middleman, or
without a lawyer.  By developing a free set of licenses that people
can attach to their content, Creative Commons aims to mark a range of
content that can easily, and reliably, be built upon. These tags are
then linked to machine-readable versions of the license that enable
computers automatically to identify content that can easily be
shared. These three expressions together&mdash;a legal license, a
human-readable description, and
<!-- PAGE BREAK 288 -->
machine-readable tags&mdash;constitute a Creative Commons license. A
Creative Commons license constitutes a grant of freedom to anyone who
accesses the license, and more importantly, an expression of the ideal
that the person associated with the license believes in something
different than the <quote>All</quote> or <quote>No</quote> extremes. Content is marked with the
CC mark, which does not mean that copyright is waived, but that
certain freedoms are given.
</para>
<para>
These freedoms are beyond the freedoms promised by fair use. Their
precise contours depend upon the choices the creator makes. The
creator can choose a license that permits any use, so long as
attribution is given. She can choose a license that permits only
noncommercial use.  She can choose a license that permits any use so
long as the same freedoms are given to other uses (<quote>share and share
alike</quote>). Or any use so long as no derivative use is made. Or any use
at all within developing nations. Or any sampling use, so long as full
copies are not made. Or lastly, any educational use.
</para>
<para>
These choices thus establish a range of freedoms beyond the default of
copyright law. They also enable freedoms that go beyond traditional
fair use. And most importantly, they express these freedoms in a way
that subsequent users can use and rely upon without the need to hire a
lawyer. Creative Commons thus aims to build a layer of content,
governed by a layer of reasonable copyright law, that others can build
upon. Voluntary choice of individuals and creators will make this
content available. And that content will in turn enable us to rebuild
a public domain.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Garlick, Mia</primary></indexterm>
<para>
This is just one project among many within the Creative Commons.  And
of course, Creative Commons is not the only organization pursuing such
freedoms. But the point that distinguishes the Creative Commons from
many is that we are not interested only in talking about a public
domain or in getting legislators to help build a public domain. Our
aim is to build a movement of consumers and producers
<!-- PAGE BREAK 289 -->
of content (<quote>content conducers,</quote> as attorney Mia Garlick calls them)
who help build the public domain and, by their work, demonstrate the
importance of the public domain to other creativity.

are produced by insane and unintended consequences of laws written
centuries ago, applied to a technology that only Jefferson could have
imagined. The rules may well have made sense against a background of
technologies from centuries ago, but they do not make sense against
the background of digital technologies. New rules&mdash;with different
freedoms, expressed in ways so that humans without lawyers can use
them&mdash;are needed. Creative Commons gives people a way effectively
to begin to build those rules.

Why would creators participate in giving up total control? Some
participate to better spread their content. Cory Doctorow, for
example, is a science fiction author. His first novel, <citetitle>Down and Out in
the Magic Kingdom</citetitle>, was released on-line and for free, under a Creative
Commons license, on the same day that it went on sale in bookstores.
</para>
<para>
Why would a publisher ever agree to this? I suspect his publisher
reasoned like this: There are two groups of people out there: (1)
those who will buy Cory's book whether or not it's on the Internet,
and (2) those who may never hear of Cory's book, if it isn't made
available for free on the Internet. Some part of (1) will download
Cory's book instead of buying it. Call them bad-(1)s. Some part of (2)
will download Cory's book, like it, and then decide to buy it. Call
them (2)-goods.  If there are more (2)-goods than bad-(1)s, the
strategy of releasing Cory's book free on-line will probably
<emphasis>increase</emphasis> sales of Cory's book.

Indeed, the experience of his publisher clearly supports that
conclusion.  The book's first printing was exhausted months before the

was a total success.

made an electronic version of his book free on-line under a Creative

used book store prices for the book. As predicted, as the number of
downloads increased, the used book price for his book increased, as
well.

These are examples of using the Commons to better spread proprietary
content. I believe that is a wonderful and common use of the
Commons. There are others who use Creative Commons licenses for other
reasons. Many who use the <quote>sampling license</quote> do so because anything
else would be hypocritical. The sampling license says that others are
free, for commercial or noncommercial purposes, to sample content from
the licensed work; they are just not free to make full copies of the
licensed work available to others. This is consistent with their own
art&mdash;they, too, sample from others. Because the
<emphasis>legal</emphasis> costs of sampling are so high (Walter
Leaphart, manager of the rap group Public Enemy, which was born

these artists release into the creative environment content

</para>
<para>
Finally, there are many who mark their content with a Creative Commons
license just because they want to express to others the importance of
balance in this debate. If you just go along with the system as it is,
you are effectively saying you believe in the <quote>All Rights Reserved</quote>
model. Good for you, but many do not. Many believe that however
appropriate that rule is for Hollywood and freaks, it is not an
appropriate description of how most creators view the rights
associated with their content. The Creative Commons license expresses
this notion of <quote>Some Rights Reserved,</quote> and gives many the chance to
say it to others.
</para>
<para>
In the first six months of the Creative Commons experiment, over
1 million objects were licensed with these free-culture licenses. The next
step is partnerships with middleware content providers to help them

with Creative Commons freedoms. Then the next step is to watch and
celebrate creators who build content based upon content set free.
</para>
<para>
These are first steps to rebuilding a public domain. They are not
mere arguments; they are action. Building a public domain is the first
step to showing people how important that domain is to creativity and
innovation. Creative Commons relies upon voluntary steps to achieve
this rebuilding. They will lead to a world in which more than voluntary
steps are possible.
</para>
<para>
Creative Commons is just one example of voluntary efforts by
individuals and creators to change the mix of rights that now govern
the creative field. The project does not compete with copyright; it
complements it. Its aim is not to defeat the rights of authors, but to
make it easier for authors and creators to exercise their rights more
flexibly and cheaply. That difference, we believe, will enable
creativity to spread more easily.

</para>
<para>
Why?
</para>
<para>
As I suggested in chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="property-i"/>, the motivation to abolish formalities was a
good one. In the world before digital technologies, formalities
imposed a burden on copyright holders without much benefit. Thus, it
was progress when the law relaxed the formal requirements that a
copyright owner must bear to protect and secure his work. Those
formalities were getting in the way.
</para>
<para>
But the Internet changes all this. Formalities today need not be a
burden. Rather, the world without formalities is the world that
burdens creativity. Today, there is no simple way to know who owns
what, or with whom one must deal in order to use or build upon the
creative work of others. There are no records, there is no system to
trace&mdash; there is no simple way to know how to get permission. Yet
given the massive increase in the scope of copyright's rule, getting
permission is a necessary step for any work that builds upon our
past. And thus, the <emphasis>lack</emphasis> of formalities forces
many into silence where they otherwise could speak.
</para>
<para>
The law should therefore change this requirement<footnote><para>
<!-- f1. -->
The proposal I am advancing here would apply to American works only.
Obviously, I believe it would be beneficial for the same idea to be
adopted by other countries as well.</para></footnote>&mdash;but it
should not change it by going back to the old, broken system. We
should require formalities, but we should establish a system that will
create the incentives to minimize the burden of these formalities.
</para>
<para>
The important formalities are three: marking copyrighted work,
registering copyrights, and renewing the claim to
copyright. Traditionally, the first of these three was something the
copyright owner did; the second two were something the government
did. But a revised system of formalities would banish the government
from the process, except for the sole purpose of approving standards
developed by others.
</para>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 294 -->

<section id="registration">
<title>Registration and renewal</title>
<para>
Under the old system, a copyright owner had to file a registration
with the Copyright Office to register or renew a copyright. When
filing that registration, the copyright owner paid a fee. As with most
government agencies, the Copyright Office had little incentive to
minimize the burden of registration; it also had little incentive to
minimize the fee.  And as the Copyright Office is not a main target of
government policymaking, the office has historically been terribly
underfunded. Thus, when people who know something about the process
hear this idea about formalities, their first reaction is
panic&mdash;nothing could be worse than forcing people to deal with
the mess that is the Copyright Office.
</para>
<para>
Yet it is always astonishing to me that we, who come from a tradition
of extraordinary innovation in governmental design, can no longer
think innovatively about how governmental functions can be designed.
Just because there is a public purpose to a government role, it
doesn't follow that the government must actually administer the
role. Instead, we should be creating incentives for private parties to
serve the public, subject to standards that the government sets.

<para>
In the context of registration, one obvious model is the Internet.
There are at least 32 million Web sites registered around the world.
Domain name owners for these Web sites have to pay a fee to keep their
registration alive. In the main top-level domains (.com, .org, .net),
there is a central registry. The actual registrations are, however,
performed by many competing registrars. That competition drives the
cost of registering down, and more importantly, it drives the ease
with which registration occurs up.
</para>
<para>
We should adopt a similar model for the registration and renewal of
copyrights. The Copyright Office may well serve as the central
registry, but it should not be in the registrar business. Instead, it
should establish a database, and a set of standards for registrars. It
should approve registrars that meet its standards. Those registrars
would then compete with one another to deliver the cheapest and
simplest systems for registering and renewing copyrights. That
competition would substantially lower the burden of this
formality&mdash;while producing a database
<!-- PAGE BREAK 295 -->
of registrations that would facilitate the licensing of content.
</para>

</section>
<section id="marking">
<title>Marking</title>
<para>
It used to be that the failure to include a copyright notice on a
creative work meant that the copyright was forfeited. That was a harsh
punishment for failing to comply with a regulatory rule&mdash;akin to
imposing the death penalty for a parking ticket in the world of
creative rights.  Here again, there is no reason that a marking
requirement needs to be enforced in this way. And more importantly,
there is no reason a marking requirement needs to be enforced
uniformly across all media.
</para>
<para>
The aim of marking is to signal to the public that this work is
copyrighted and that the author wants to enforce his rights. The mark
also makes it easy to locate a copyright owner to secure permission to
use the work.
</para>
<para>
One of the problems the copyright system confronted early on was
that different copyrighted works had to be differently marked. It wasn't
clear how or where a statue was to be marked, or a record, or a film. A
new marking requirement could solve these problems by recognizing
the differences in media, and by allowing the system of marking to
evolve as technologies enable it to. The system could enable a special
signal from the failure to mark&mdash;not the loss of the copyright, but the
loss of the right to punish someone for failing to get permission first.
</para>
<para>
Let's start with the last point. If a copyright owner allows his work
to be published without a copyright notice, the consequence of that
failure need not be that the copyright is lost. The consequence could
instead be that anyone has the right to use this work, until the
copyright owner complains and demonstrates that it is his work and he
doesn't give permission.<footnote><para>
<!-- f2. -->
There would be a complication with derivative works that I have not
solved here. In my view, the law of derivatives creates a more complicated
system than is justified by the marginal incentive it creates.
</para></footnote>
The meaning of an unmarked work would therefore be <quote>use unless someone
complains.</quote> If someone does complain, then the obligation would be to
stop using the work in any new
<!-- PAGE BREAK 296 -->
work from then on though no penalty would attach for existing uses.
This would create a strong incentive for copyright owners to mark
their work.
</para>
<para>
That in turn raises the question about how work should best be
marked. Here again, the system needs to adjust as the technologies
evolve. The best way to ensure that the system evolves is to limit the
Copyright Office's role to that of approving standards for marking
content that have been crafted elsewhere.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>CDs</primary><secondary>copyright marking of</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
For example, if a recording industry association devises a method for
marking CDs, it would propose that to the Copyright Office. The
Copyright Office would hold a hearing, at which other proposals could
be made. The Copyright Office would then select the proposal that it
judged preferable, and it would base that choice
<emphasis>solely</emphasis> upon the consideration of which method
could best be integrated into the registration and renewal system. We
would not count on the government to innovate; but we would count on
the government to keep the product of innovation in line with its
other important functions.
</para>
<para>
Finally, marking content clearly would simplify registration
requirements.  If photographs were marked by author and year, there
would be little reason not to allow a photographer to reregister, for
example, all photographs taken in a particular year in one quick
step. The aim of the formality is not to burden the creator; the
system itself should be kept as simple as possible.
</para>
<para>
The objective of formalities is to make things clear. The existing
system does nothing to make things clear. Indeed, it seems designed to
make things unclear.
</para>
<para>
If formalities such as registration were reinstated, one of the most
difficult aspects of relying upon the public domain would be removed.
It would be simple to identify what content is presumptively free; it
would be simple to identify who controls the rights for a particular
kind of content; it would be simple to assert those rights, and to renew
that assertion at the appropriate time.

<title>2. Shorter Terms</title>
<para>
The term of copyright has gone from fourteen years to ninety-five
years for corporate authors, and life of the author plus seventy years for
natural authors.
</para>
<para>
In <citetitle>The Future of Ideas</citetitle>, I proposed a seventy-five-year term,
granted in five-year increments with a requirement of renewal every
five years.  That seemed radical enough at the time. But after we lost
<citetitle>Eldred</citetitle> v. <citetitle>Ashcroft</citetitle>, the proposals became even more
radical. <citetitle>The Economist</citetitle> endorsed a proposal for a fourteen-year
copyright term.<footnote><para>

I agree with those who believe that we need a radical change in
copyright's term. But whether fourteen years or seventy-five, there
are four principles that are important to keep in mind about copyright
terms.
</para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>
<!-- (1) -->
<emphasis>Keep it short:</emphasis> The term should be as long as
necessary to give incentives to create, but no longer. If it were tied
to very strong protections for authors (so authors were able to
reclaim rights from publishers), rights to the same work (not
derivative works) might be extended further. The key is not to tie the
work up with legal regulations when it no longer benefits an author.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
<!-- (2) -->
<emphasis>Keep it simple:</emphasis> The line between the public
domain and protected content must be kept clear. Lawyers like the
fuzziness of <quote>fair use,</quote> and the distinction between <quote>ideas</quote> and
<quote>expression.</quote>  That kind of law gives them lots of work. But our
framers had a simpler idea in mind: protected versus unprotected.  The
value of short terms is that there is little need to build exceptions
into copyright when the term itself is kept short. A clear and active
<quote>lawyer-free zone</quote> makes the complexities of <quote>fair use</quote> and
<quote>idea/expression</quote> less necessary to navigate.

<para>
<!-- (3) -->
<emphasis>Keep it alive:</emphasis> Copyright should have to be
renewed.  Especially if the maximum term is long, the copyright owner
should be required to signal periodically that he wants the protection
continued. This need not be an onerous burden, but there is no reason
this monopoly protection has to be granted for free. On average, it
takes ninety minutes for a veteran to apply for a
pension.<footnote><para>

If we make veterans suffer that burden, I don't see why we couldn't
require authors to spend ten minutes every fifty years to file a
single form.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
<!-- (4) -->
<emphasis>Keep it prospective:</emphasis> Whatever the term of
copyright should be, the clearest lesson that economists teach is that
a term once given should not be extended. It might have been a mistake
in 1923 for the law to offer authors only a fifty-six-year term. I
don't think so, but it's possible. If it was a mistake, then the
consequence was that we got fewer authors to create in 1923 than we
otherwise would have. But we can't correct that mistake today by
increasing the term. No matter what we do today, we will not increase
the number of authors who wrote in 1923. Of course, we can increase
the reward that those who write now get (or alternatively, increase
the copyright burden that smothers many works that are today
invisible). But increasing their reward will not increase their
creativity in 1923.  What's not done is not done, and there's nothing
we can do about that now.  </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
These changes together should produce an <emphasis>average</emphasis>
copyright term that is much shorter than the current term. Until 1976,
the average term was just 32.2 years. We should be aiming for the
same.
</para>
<para>
No doubt the extremists will call these ideas <quote>radical.</quote> (After all, I
call them <quote>extremists.</quote>) But again, the term I recommended was longer
than the term under Richard Nixon. How <quote>radical</quote> can it be to ask for
a more generous copyright law than Richard Nixon presided over?

I think it's time to recognize that there are airplanes in this field and
the expansiveness of these rights of derivative use no longer make
sense. More precisely, they don't make sense for the period of time that
a copyright runs. And they don't make sense as an amorphous grant.
Consider each limitation in turn.

<emphasis>Scope:</emphasis> Likewise should the scope of derivative
rights be narrowed.  Again, there are some cases in which derivative
rights are important.  Those should be specified. But the law should
draw clear lines around regulated and unregulated uses of copyrighted
material. When all <quote>reuse</quote> of creative material was within the control
of businesses, perhaps it made sense to require lawyers to negotiate
the lines. It no longer makes sense for lawyers to negotiate the
lines. Think about all the creative possibilities that digital
technologies enable; now imagine pouring molasses into the
machines. That's what this general requirement of permission does to
the creative process. Smothers it.

<para>
This was the point that Alben made when describing the making of the
Clint Eastwood CD. While it makes sense to require negotiation for
foreseeable derivative rights&mdash;turning a book into a movie, or a
poem into a musical score&mdash;it doesn't make sense to require
negotiation for the unforeseeable. Here, a statutory right would make
much more sense.
</para>
<para>
In each of these cases, the law should mark the uses that are
protected, and the presumption should be that other uses are not
protected.  This is the reverse of the recommendation of my colleague
Paul Goldstein.<footnote>

His view is that the law should be written so that
expanded protections follow expanded uses.
</para>
<para>
Goldstein's analysis would make perfect sense if the cost of the legal
system were small. But as we are currently seeing in the context of
the Internet, the uncertainty about the scope of protection, and the
incentives to protect existing architectures of revenue, combined with
a strong copyright, weaken the process of innovation.
</para>
<para>
The law could remedy this problem either by removing protection

beyond the part explicitly drawn or by granting reuse rights upon
certain statutory conditions. Either way, the effect would be to free
a great deal of culture to others to cultivate. And under a statutory
rights regime, that reuse would earn artists more income.

<title>4. Liberate the Music&mdash;Again</title>
<para>
The battle that got this whole war going was about music, so it
wouldn't be fair to end this book without addressing the issue that
is, to most people, most pressing&mdash;music. There is no other
policy issue that better teaches the lessons of this book than the
battles around the sharing of music.
</para>
<para>
The appeal of file-sharing music was the crack cocaine of the
Internet's growth. It drove demand for access to the Internet more
powerfully than any other single application. It was the Internet's
killer app&mdash;possibly in two senses of that word. It no doubt was
the application that drove demand for bandwidth. It may well be the
application that drives demand for regulations that in the end kill
innovation on the network.
</para>
<para>
The aim of copyright, with respect to content in general and music in
particular, is to create the incentives for music to be composed,
performed, and, most importantly, spread. The law does this by giving
an exclusive right to a composer to control public performances of his
work, and to a performing artist to control copies of her performance.
</para>
<para>
File-sharing networks complicate this model by enabling the spread of
content for which the performer has not been paid. But of course,
that's not all the file-sharing networks do. As I described in chapter
<xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber" linkend="piracy"/>, they enable
four different kinds of sharing:

</orderedlist>
<indexterm><primary>cassette recording</primary><secondary>VCRs</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>VCRs</primary></indexterm>
<para>
Any reform of the law needs to keep these different uses in focus. It
must avoid burdening type D even if it aims to eliminate type A. The
eagerness with which the law aims to eliminate type A, moreover,
should depend upon the magnitude of type B. As with VCRs, if the net
effect of sharing is actually not very harmful, the need for regulation is
significantly weakened.
</para>
<para>
As I said in chapter <xref xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"
linkend="piracy"/>, the actual harm caused by sharing is
controversial.  For the purposes of this chapter, however, I assume
the harm is real. I assume, in other words, that type A sharing is
significantly greater than type B, and is the dominant use of sharing
networks.
</para>
<para>
Nonetheless, there is a crucial fact about the current technological
context that we must keep in mind if we are to understand how the law
should respond.
</para>
<para>
Today, file sharing is addictive. In ten years, it won't be. It is
addictive today because it is the easiest way to gain access to a
broad range of content.  It won't be the easiest way to get access to
a broad range of content in ten years. Today, access to the Internet
is cumbersome and slow&mdash;we in the United States are lucky to have
broadband service at 1.5 MBs, and very rarely do we get service at
that speed both up and down. Although wireless access is growing, most
of us still get access across wires. Most only gain access through a
machine with a keyboard. The idea of the always on, always connected
Internet is mainly just an idea.
</para>
<para>
But it will become a reality, and that means the way we get access to
the Internet today is a technology in transition. Policy makers should
not make policy on the basis of technology in transition. They should
<!-- PAGE BREAK 303 -->
make policy on the basis of where the technology is going. The
question should not be, how should the law regulate sharing in this
world?  The question should be, what law will we require when the
network becomes the network it is clearly becoming? That network is
one in which every machine with electricity is essentially on the Net;
where everywhere you are&mdash;except maybe the desert or the
Rockies&mdash;you can instantaneously be connected to the
Internet. Imagine the Internet as ubiquitous as the best cell-phone
service, where with the flip of a device, you are connected.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>cell phones, music streamed over</primary></indexterm>
<para>
In that world, it will be extremely easy to connect to services that
give you access to content on the fly&mdash;such as Internet radio,
content that is streamed to the user when the user demands. Here,
then, is the critical point: When it is <emphasis>extremely</emphasis>
easy to connect to services that give access to content, it will be
<emphasis>easier</emphasis> to connect to services that give you
access to content than it will be to download and store content
<emphasis>on the many devices you will have for playing
content</emphasis>. It will be easier, in other words, to subscribe
than it will be to be a database manager, as everyone in the
download-sharing world of Napster-like technologies essentially
is. Content services will compete with content sharing, even if the
services charge money for the content they give access to. Already
cell-phone services in Japan offer music (for a fee) streamed over
cell phones (enhanced with plugs for headphones). The Japanese are
paying for this content even though <quote>free</quote> content is available in the
form of MP3s across the Web.<footnote><para>

</para></footnote>

</para>
<para>
This point about the future is meant to suggest a perspective on the
present: It is emphatically temporary. The <quote>problem</quote> with file
sharing&mdash;to the extent there is a real problem&mdash;is a problem
that will increasingly disappear as it becomes easier to connect to
the Internet.  And thus it is an extraordinary mistake for policy
makers today to be <quote>solving</quote> this problem in light of a technology
that will be gone tomorrow.  The question should not be how to
regulate the Internet to eliminate file sharing (the Net will evolve
that problem away). The question instead should be how to assure that
artists get paid, during

<!-- PAGE BREAK 304 -->
this transition between twentieth-century models for doing business
and twenty-first-century technologies.
</para>
<para>
The answer begins with recognizing that there are different <quote>problems</quote>
here to solve. Let's start with type D content&mdash;uncopyrighted
content or copyrighted content that the artist wants shared. The
<quote>problem</quote> with this content is to make sure that the technology that
would enable this kind of sharing is not rendered illegal. You can
think of it this way: Pay phones are used to deliver ransom demands,
no doubt.  But there are many who need to use pay phones who have
nothing to do with ransoms. It would be wrong to ban pay phones in
order to eliminate kidnapping.
</para>
<para>
Type C content raises a different <quote>problem.</quote> This is content that was,
at one time, published and is no longer available. It may be
unavailable because the artist is no longer valuable enough for the
record label he signed with to carry his work. Or it may be
unavailable because the work is forgotten. Either way, the aim of the
law should be to facilitate the access to this content, ideally in a
way that returns something to the artist.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>books</primary><secondary>out of print</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>books</primary><secondary>resales of</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
Again, the model here is the used book store. Once a book goes out of
print, it may still be available in libraries and used book
stores. But libraries and used book stores don't pay the copyright
owner when someone reads or buys an out-of-print book. That makes
total sense, of course, since any other system would be so burdensome
as to eliminate the possibility of used book stores' existing. But
from the author's perspective, this <quote>sharing</quote> of his content without
his being compensated is less than ideal.
</para>
<para>
The model of used book stores suggests that the law could simply deem
out-of-print music fair game. If the publisher does not make copies of
the music available for sale, then commercial and noncommercial
providers would be free, under this rule, to <quote>share</quote> that content,
even though the sharing involved making a copy. The copy here would be
incidental to the trade; in a context where commercial publishing has
ended, trading music should be as free as trading books.
</para>
<para>

<!-- PAGE BREAK 305 -->
Alternatively, the law could create a statutory license that would
ensure that artists get something from the trade of their work. For
example, if the law set a low statutory rate for the commercial
sharing of content that was not offered for sale by a commercial
publisher, and if that rate were automatically transferred to a trust
for the benefit of the artist, then businesses could develop around
the idea of trading this content, and artists would benefit from this
trade.
</para>
<para>
This system would also create an incentive for publishers to keep
works available commercially. Works that are available commercially
would not be subject to this license. Thus, publishers could protect
the right to charge whatever they want for content if they kept the
work commercially available. But if they don't keep it available, and
instead, the computer hard disks of fans around the world keep it
alive, then any royalty owed for such copying should be much less than
the amount owed a commercial publisher.
</para>
<para>
The hard case is content of types A and B, and again, this case is
hard only because the extent of the problem will change over time, as
the technologies for gaining access to content change. The law's
solution should be as flexible as the problem is, understanding that
we are in the middle of a radical transformation in the technology for
delivering and accessing content.
</para>
<para>
So here's a solution that will at first seem very strange to both sides
in this war, but which upon reflection, I suggest, should make some sense.
</para>
<para>
Stripped of the rhetoric about the sanctity of property, the basic
claim of the content industry is this: A new technology (the Internet)
has harmed a set of rights that secure copyright. If those rights are to
be protected, then the content industry should be compensated for that
harm. Just as the technology of tobacco harmed the health of millions
of Americans, or the technology of asbestos caused grave illness to
thousands of miners, so, too, has the technology of digital networks
harmed the interests of the content industry.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 306 -->
I love the Internet, and so I don't like likening it to tobacco or
asbestos.  But the analogy is a fair one from the perspective of the
law.  And it suggests a fair response: Rather than seeking to destroy
the Internet, or the p2p technologies that are currently harming
content providers on the Internet, we should find a relatively simple
way to compensate those who are harmed.

Fisher's proposal is very similar to Richard Stallman's proposal for
DAT. Unlike Fisher's, Stallman's proposal would not pay artists directly
proportionally, though more popular artists would get more than the less
popular. As is typical with Stallman, his proposal predates the current 
debate by about a decade. See

Fisher suggests a very clever way around the current impasse of the
Internet. Under his plan, all content capable of digital transmission
would (1) be marked with a digital watermark (don't worry about how
easy it is to evade these marks; as you'll see, there's no incentive
to evade them). Once the content is marked, then entrepreneurs would
develop (2) systems to monitor how many items of each content were
distributed. On the basis of those numbers, then (3) artists would be
compensated. The compensation would be paid for by (4) an appropriate
tax.
</para>
<para>
Fisher's proposal is careful and comprehensive. It raises a million
questions, most of which he answers well in his upcoming book,
<citetitle>Promises to Keep</citetitle>. The modification that I would make is relatively
simple: Fisher imagines his proposal replacing the existing copyright
system.  I imagine it complementing the existing system. The aim of
the proposal would be to facilitate compensation to the extent that
harm could be shown. This compensation would be temporary, aimed at
facilitating a transition between regimes. And it would require
renewal after a period of years. If it continues to make sense to
facilitate free exchange of content, supported through a taxation
system, then it can be continued. If this form of protection is no
longer necessary, then the system could lapse into the old system of
controlling access.

easier than free is. This has proven correct: Apple has sold millions

the cost is the equivalent of a per-song CD price, though the labels
have none of the costs of a CD to pay.) Apple's move was countered by
Real Networks, offering music at just 79 cents a song. And no doubt
there will be a great deal of competition to offer and sell music

Indeed, if anything, the competition spurs the competitors to offer
new and better products. This is precisely what the competitive market
was to be about. Thus in Singapore, though piracy is rampant, movie

This regime of competition, with a backstop to assure that artists

But what if <quote>piracy</quote> doesn't disappear? What if there is a competitive
market providing content at a low cost, but a significant number of
consumers continue to <quote>take</quote> content for nothing? Should the law do
something then?
</para>
<para>
Yes, it should. But, again, what it should do depends upon how the
facts develop. These changes may not eliminate type A sharing. But the
real issue is not whether it eliminates sharing in the abstract.  The
real issue is its effect on the market. Is it better (a) to have a
technology that is 95 percent secure and produces a market of size <citetitle>x</citetitle>,
or (b) to have a technology that is 50 percent secure but produces a
market of five times <citetitle>x</citetitle>? Less secure might produce more unauthorized
sharing, but it is likely to also produce a much bigger market in
authorized sharing. The most important thing is to assure artists'
compensation without breaking the Internet. Once that's assured, then
it may well be appropriate to find ways to track down the petty
pirates.
</para>
<para>
But we're a long way away from whittling the problem down to this
subset of type A sharers. And our focus until we're there should not
be on finding ways to break the Internet. Our focus until we're there

<!-- PAGE BREAK 309 -->
should be on how to make sure the artists are paid, while protecting
the space for innovation and creativity that the Internet is.

<title>5. Fire Lots of Lawyers</title>
<para>
I'm a lawyer. I make lawyers for a living. I believe in the law. I believe
in the law of copyright. Indeed, I have devoted my life to working in
law, not because there are big bucks at the end but because there are
ideals at the end that I would love to live.
</para>
<para>
Yet much of this book has been a criticism of lawyers, or the role
lawyers have played in this debate. The law speaks to ideals, but it
is my view that our profession has become too attuned to the
client. And in a world where the rich clients have one strong view,
the unwillingness of the profession to question or counter that one
strong view queers the law.

<para>
The evidence of this bending is compelling. I'm attacked as a
<quote>radical</quote> by many within the profession, yet the positions that I am
advocating are precisely the positions of some of the most moderate
and significant figures in the history of this branch of the
law. Many, for example, thought crazy the challenge that we brought to
the Copyright Term Extension Act. Yet just thirty years ago, the
dominant scholar and practitioner in the field of copyright, Melville
Nimmer, thought it obvious.<footnote><para>

</para></footnote>

</para>
<para>
However, my criticism of the role that lawyers have played in this
debate is not just about a professional bias. It is more importantly
about our failure to actually reckon the costs of the law.
</para>
<para>
Economists are supposed to be good at reckoning costs and benefits.
But more often than not, economists, with no clue about how the legal
system actually functions, simply assume that the transaction costs of
the legal system are slight.<footnote><para>
<!-- f11. -->
A good example is the work of Professor Stan Liebowitz. Liebowitz is
to be commended for his careful review of data about infringement,
leading him to question his own publicly stated
position&mdash;twice. He initially predicted that downloading would
substantially harm the industry. He then revised his view in light of
the data, and he has since revised his view again.  Compare Stan
J. Liebowitz, <citetitle>Rethinking the Network Economy: The True Forces That
Drive the Digital Marketplace</citetitle> (New York: Amacom, 2002), (reviewing his
original view but expressing skepticism) with Stan J.  Liebowitz,
<quote>Will MP3s Annihilate the Record Industry?</quote> working paper, June 2003,
available at
<ulink url="http://free-culture.cc/notes/">link #86</ulink>.
Liebowitz's careful analysis is extremely valuable in estimating the
effect of file-sharing technology. In my view, however, he
underestimates the costs of the legal system. See, for example,
<citetitle>Rethinking</citetitle>, 174&ndash;76.
<indexterm><primary>Liebowitz, Stan</primary></indexterm>
</para></footnote>
They see a system that has been around for hundreds of years, and they
assume it works the way their elementary school civics class taught
them it works.
</para>
<para>
<!-- PAGE BREAK 310 -->
But the legal system doesn't work. Or more accurately, it doesn't work
for anyone except those with the most resources. Not because the
system is corrupt. I don't think our legal system (at the federal
level, at least) is at all corrupt. I mean simply because the costs of
our legal system are so astonishingly high that justice can
practically never be done.
</para>
<para>
These costs distort free culture in many ways. A lawyer's time is
billed at the largest firms at more than $400 per hour. How much time
should such a lawyer spend reading cases carefully, or researching
obscure strands of authority? The answer is the increasing reality:
very little.  The law depended upon the careful articulation and
development of doctrine, but the careful articulation and development
of legal doctrine depends upon careful work. Yet that careful work
costs too much, except in the most high-profile and costly cases.
</para>
<para>
The costliness and clumsiness and randomness of this system mock
our tradition. And lawyers, as well as academics, should consider it
their duty to change the way the law works&mdash;or better, to change the
law so that it works. It is wrong that the system works well only for the
top 1 percent of the clients. It could be made radically more efficient,
and inexpensive, and hence radically more just.
</para>
<para>
But until that reform is complete, we as a society should keep the law
away from areas that we know it will only harm. And that is precisely
what the law will too often do if too much of our culture is left to
its review.

Think about the amazing things your kid could do or make with digital
technology&mdash;the film, the music, the Web page, the blog. Or think
about the amazing things your community could facilitate with digital
technology&mdash;a wiki, a barn raising, activism to change something.
Think about all those creative things, and then imagine cold molasses
poured onto the machines. This is what any regime that requires
permission produces. Again, this is the reality of Brezhnev's Russia.
</para>
<para>
The law should regulate in certain areas of culture&mdash;but it should
regulate culture only where that regulation does good. Yet lawyers

rarely test their power, or the power they promote, against this
simple pragmatic question: <quote>Will it do good?</quote> When challenged about
the expanding reach of the law, the lawyer answers, <quote>Why not?</quote>

We should ask, <quote>Why?</quote> Show me why your regulation of culture is
needed. Show me how it does good. And until you can show me both,

This book is the product of a long and as yet unsuccessful struggle that
began when I read of Eric Eldred's war to keep books free. Eldred's
work helped launch a movement, the free culture movement, and it is
to him that this book is dedicated.

I received guidance in various places from friends and academics,
including Glenn Brown, Peter DiCola, Jennifer Mnookin, Richard Posner,
Mark Rose, and Kathleen Sullivan. And I received correction and
guidance from many amazing students at Stanford Law School and
Stanford University. They included Andrew B. Coan, John Eden, James
P. Fellers, Christopher Guzelian, Erica Goldberg, Robert Hallman,
Andrew Harris, Matthew Kahn, Brian Link, Ohad Mayblum, Alina Ng, and
Erica Platt. I am particularly grateful to Catherine Crump and Harry
Surden, who helped direct their research, and to Laura Lynch, who
brilliantly managed the army that they assembled, and provided her own
critical eye on much of this.

Yuko Noguchi helped me to understand the laws of Japan as well as
its culture. I am thankful to her, and to the many in Japan who helped
me prepare this book: Joi Ito, Takayuki Matsutani, Naoto Misaki,
Michihiro Sasaki, Hiromichi Tanaka, Hiroo Yamagata, and Yoshihiro

Yonezawa. I am thankful as well as to Professor Nobuhiro Nakayama,
and the Tokyo University Business Law Center, for giving me the
chance to spend time in Japan, and to Tadashi Shiraishi and Kiyokazu
Yamagami for their generous help while I was there.

These are the traditional sorts of help that academics regularly draw
upon. But in addition to them, the Internet has made it possible to
receive advice and correction from many whom I have never even
met. Among those who have responded with extremely helpful advice to
requests on my blog about the book are Dr. Mohammad Al-Ubaydli, David
Gerstein, and Peter DiMauro, as well as a long list of those who had
specific ideas about ways to develop my argument. They included
Richard Bondi, Steven Cherry, David Coe, Nik Cubrilovic, Bob Devine,
Charles Eicher, Thomas Guida, Elihu M. Gerson, Jeremy Hunsinger,
Vaughn Iverson, John Karabaic, Jeff Keltner, James Lindenschmidt,
K. L. Mann, Mark Manning, Nora McCauley, Jeffrey McHugh, Evan

computers come glitches, and a crash of my e-mail system meant I lost

Richard Stallman and Michael Carroll each read the whole book in
draft, and each provided extremely helpful correction and advice.
Michael helped me to see more clearly the significance of the
regulation of derivitive works. And Richard corrected an
embarrassingly large number of errors. While my work is in part
inspired by Stallman's, he does not agree with me in important places
throughout this book.

Finally, and forever, I am thankful to Bettina, who has always

grateful for her perpetual patience and love.
