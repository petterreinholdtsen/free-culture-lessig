Tips regarding DocBook XML tagging
==================================

To get entries in the Index at the back, add entries like this in the
docbook source:

  <indexterm><primary>ABC</primary></indexterm>

This will result in the entry ABC showing up in the Index, with a
reference to the page where it is mentioned.

To get two levels in the index at the back, add entries like this to
the docbook source:

  <indexterm>
  <primary>artists</primary>
  <secondary>publicity rights on images of</secondary>
  </indexterm>

To index a range of paragrams/pages:

  <indexterm id="idxexchap" class='startofrange'>
    <primary>Example Chapter</primary></indexterm>
  ...
  <indexterm startref="idxexchap" class="endofrange"/>
