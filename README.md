Text flow
---------

The original source for the book is freeculture.xml, a Docbook
formattet file.  This file is transformed to the freeculture.pot,
which is the base file for translators.  It was copied to
freeculture.nb.po as the starting point of the Norwegian Bokmål
translation, and the text blocks are translated in this file.

Only the files freeculture.xml and freeculture.nb.po should be
manually edited!

The freeculture.xml file is automatically combined with the
freeculture.nb.po file to create a new generated file
freeculture.nb.xml representing the Norwegian Bokmål Docbook version.
This file is in turn used to generate the HTML, PDF and EPUB version
of the book.

Requirements
------------

To build the PDF and EPUB version of this book, the following Debian
