See
http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Dugnad_for___sende_norsk_versjon_av_Free_Culture_til_stortingets_representanter_.html
for a project description.

Norwegian translation of the book Free Culture by Lessig.  Based on
the <a href="http://www.sslug.dk/~chlor/lessig/">Docbook version by
Hans Schou</a>.  Other versions of the book can be found from the
<a href="http://free-culture.cc/remixes/">books remixes list</a>.

The first draft had images found in the HTML version available from
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/ebooks/Lessig/index.html">Elegant
Ebooks</a>, while later draft had these replaced with the original
images provided by the author.

The source of this project is available from the
<a href="https://github.com/petterreinholdtsen/free-culture-lessig">free-culture-lessig
github repository</a>.


Text flow
---------

The original source for the book is freeculture.xml, a Docbook
formattet file.  This file is transformed to the freeculture.pot,
which is the base file for translators.  It was copied to
freeculture.nb.po as the starting point of the Norwegian Bokmål
translation, and the text blocks are translated in this file.  The
translation is maintained using
<a href="https://www.transifex.com/pere/free-culture-lessig/">Transifex</a>,
making sure translators only need a browser and Internet connectivity
to contribute.

Only the file freeculture.xml should be manually edited!

The freeculture.xml file is automatically combined with the
freeculture.nb.po file to create a new generated file
freeculture.nb.xml representing the Norwegian Bokmål Docbook version.
This file is in turn used to generate the HTML, PDF and EPUB version
of the book.
